"i've been here twice, and the service just keeps getting worse and worse.  i meet up with a bunch of friends and had to flag a waitress down to take my drink order.  i ordered the fish and chips and the portion was on the small side.  i considered giving this place two stars because the fish was good.  however, the service was so bad that i couldn't.  not once did our waitress come by and ask if everything was okay or if we needed anything else.  we always had to flag someone to get her.",1
"Check in friendly enough, room nice and what you would expect from a jw marriott. The hotel is in good nick as its only a year old (now '11) The first night interupted by roadworks at 2am (not the hotels fault) followed by drunk teenagers / twenty somethings racing through the halls at 3am ( to me the hotels fault) Next night a wedding on our floor resulted in 3hours of noise as the service elevator was across from our door. Waiters were shouting to each other, metal carts banging, walkie talkies blaring etc.  music from the wedding audible till midnight.  We were offered a room on another floor, but who wants to get out of bed, pack and move rooms. The situation should not happen. We decided not to move so were offered free breakfast, appreciated but kind of missed the point. I may have b",1
"rip off.  $10.95 for a maybe 4 oz pastrami sandwich?   I dont think so.  If it was not a Sunday I would have headed over to Manny's on Clinton for a 12 oz pastrami for $11.95.  If you are going to be a NY style deli, then at least fill up the sandwich to 50% of what you would get in NY..... Matza Ball soup is lacking flavor.  Too bad,   They also need to work on the service.  Fries came out cold and could not find the waiter to get replacement until half my sandwich was gone.  The excuse that it was a very busy Sunday?  Duh! Then they should have staffed accordingly After being in business for a few years, they should have had it down by now.  They were a lot better in the beginning.",1
"Very Slow service. Abrasive owner and manager. Overpriced, small portioned food. In short, if you want a real diner with excellent food, walk 6 blocks to Manny's.",1
"Ghostbar is an overpriced and 'wannabe' swanky joint.  I went for a large social event where everyone was classy and spending big bucks, but we somehow managed to receive horrible service.  Our bartender, Dion (yes, I called him out) was super rude and clearly hadn't had any customer service training.  It was bad enough that the drinks were overpriced and very weak, but then to have Dion go off on me and my friends was the most uncouth thing I have ever experienced. This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous. I can only assume that is the reason the individual tipped lightly.  But, that was none of my business because my friends and I had been leaving hefty tips all evening. When I asked Dion for another dr",1
"Food is good but the bar staff is so lame. I have been here more that a few times because of the good location and the British beer selection but every time I come here the bar treats the customers like tourist trash who they couldn't be bothered to lower themselves to actually care about what the customer wants. I am not a tourist and I don't feel welcome. Don't ask them to put a game on as they are too cool to care?",1
"I've been here numerous times and was never impressed but was willing to give it an 'eh...it's not terrible' kind of review. BUT They toyed with my pumpkin lovin' ass. All bets are off! They put out these flyers advertising an 'October special' pumpkin martinis complete with a picture of a very nice looking pumpkin martini and guess what? NO pumpkin martinis. The waitress even said 'nope, we don't have those but that's a good idea.' ya think?",1

"i know, i know. no one likes a bad review...but unfortunately, this was the worst brunch ever and i would hate for any yelpers to be subjected to such a thing due to me not reporting the facts. now let's get down to brass tacks: 1. seriously bad 'mimosa.' mine tasted nothing like orange juice, wasn't sparkling, and was basically undrinkable. how hard is it to make a good mimosa? i mean, i am pretty tolerant when it comes to mimosa-type drinks but this was unforgivable. 2. bad bloody marys. really really bad. no one came close to finishing theirs. 3. cold eggs, no choice of what type of toast you wanted, and gross sausage. the service was good so i feel bad giving one star, but it was really the worst brunch i've ever experienced. i don't know what has changed since the brunch i ate here a ",1
"the turkey theme is weird. The falafel sandwich is barely passable and the veggie plate is ok. i go here on those cold days where i can walk across the walkway and pick up a bite without having to dress up to go outside. UPDATE: can no longer look past the gruesome dead turkey display. flesh is flying everywhere including into the falafel. ick.",1
"I made an ass of myself for suggesting this place.  We went there last night to grab a bite to eat and some drinks, in celebration of the Hawks' win.  We went in and were surprised  the place was not very busy; finding a table was not difficult.  After a while of no service, we asked the hostess if she could take our order; understandably, she said she was just a hostess and would find someone to help us.  Waited longer and people came in and sat at the table next to us.  A waitress took their drink order within minutes of them sitting down.  We assumed the waitress would assist us when she was finished taking their order, but did not.  The table next to us was able to submit, and receive, two sets of drink orders before we were successful in even having a waitress say hello to us.  After ",1
"I love Jimmy John's. Except for this one. I just moved to an office next door to this location, and they absolutely suck. Of the four times I've eaten there, my order has been wrong every time. And today I even asked them to double check that it was right and it was STILL wrong! I think it's because no one who works there speaks English. And the worst part is that every time I've been there I have been the only person in the place (1:30-2:00ish). From now on I am going to walk the few extra blocks to the new JJ's on Adams & Clinton.",1
"Pretty ridiculous that this place does not deliver fountain drinks.  Even more ridiculous they charge $1.75 for a can of pop.  I Hate this JJs",1
"Would not recommend for brunch.  Went there over the weekend and the food was very mediocre.  How can you go wrong with french toast??  Service was ok.",1
"I had the worst service experience of my life here. My friend complained because it took almost an hour for them to make our pizza. I understand that these pizzas take a while to cook and a long wait is the norm, so I wasn't going to make a big deal about it, but it mattered to my friend. The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary. Then the manager ripped the pizza out of my friend's hands and charged his card back and yelled 'THERE, now you can go wait somewhere else for your meal!!'. He continued to verbally abuse us as we walked out in a st",1
"This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE only: I live across the street from this place and eat here often.  Usually, i just get the pizza for carry out.  I HATE the fact that they want to charge you for gardinaire peppers when their counterparts in the suburbs are so friendly about it.  This place specifically really needs to work on its customer service.  When you're charging 22 dollars for a large stuffed spinach, a small cup of gardinaire isn't going to kill you, and you can't count it as a topping since my g/f only wants it for her slices (2).   Secondly, I ate there last night on a dine in basis, and the service was also horrible.  I left a note at the end that said 'Why your tip stinks' and I listed the following reasons: They never refilled my water.   I asked for gardinaire pepper",1
"cardboard comparable to little ceasar's. -both thin and stuffed pie.  Slow service-ignored us.  I am a New yorker who worked in italian joints for years, and also even at an UNO's, which is better. this place had good fresh toppings, but the dry crust was OLD OLD OLD. what a waste of time and tummy space, next time, GINO'S EAST!",1
"Im truly disappointed in any one who wrote a good review for this establishment.  The prices are ridiculous the burgers are not cooked to order the fries were soggy and under seasoned the burger was flavorless and worst of all my egg was cold overcooked and broken!  The strawberry shake was good staff was friendly but 27 bucks for two people all I can say is Im disappointed and who ever thinks this place is good has never been to kumas",1
"As a caveat I did not eat here. Tried to, but was unsuccessful due to the fact that they booked a party of 215 people (a high school field trip) for dinner at 6:30 pm. They might as well have just shut down the entire restaurant during this time because there were only a handful of tables available for other diners, and all the students lining up in the middle of the restaurant to get their food buffet style was very chaotic. I waited with my party for at least 20 mins, but no tables were called during this time at all, and I realized we would not get seated until the field trip had left the building. This was not my idea of a fun night out, and I was starving, so I bailed on my friends and went to eat somewhere else. IMHO restaurants should not book large parties like this during the dinn",1
"Probably one of the most mediocre, slowest, and overpriced places in the area. None of the items on the menu really stand out. The service is very slow which is fine if you're dining in, but for  takeout, waiting 45 minutes isn't really acceptable. Especially when all you've ordered is a sandwich that doesn't require much prep.",1
"Facility: The place is cramped and small. You sit right on top of the people in the next tiny table for two.   Cleanliness: The place could use a good cleaning. Even the entrance way was dirty. My wife and I are from out of town, so heard that this place had good pizza, so we thought we'd try it. We arrived at this restaurant and saw empty tables, so we thought a table for two would be easy. The manager explained that they did not have enough servers to service all of the tables, so we'd have to wait for a table. He said it would be a long wait. They finally admitted that there was a large party due in and were holding the tables for them. I wish they had just told us the truth in the beginning. When a restaurant lies to you, it makes you wonder what else they would do to make a buck. They",1
"As someone who pays for everything by credit card - you must have a $10 minimum order to use a credit card here. Since pretty much everything is under $10 here, don't stop by yourself for lunch if you don't have any cash. The place is very run down and gross looking, but despite this I was desperate to try it as the Yelp reviews label this place as Americanized Chinese and I have been searching for just that in this area for forever. I guess it's Americanized Chinese. I ordered the chicken lo mein, hoping for the ramen-type noodles I've been craving since I moved here. Every other Chinese place in River North has gross, weird tiny thin noodles labeled as lo mein. That's certainly not the case here. They don't have ramen noodles or weird thin noodles either - instead they literally use SPAG",1
"I have been to JW twice and each time the service and food left me feeling blue after it was all said and done. Our server said to sit anywhere we like. Ok...does that mean once we are seated if we are not in an area that has a server assigned that we are left to go back and make the food ourselves? We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again. We sat in whats considered the 'Bar' area and not the booths. It was a Bears game so it was a bit crowded but not enough for yet again terrible",1
"Went here for a post Reeling hunger quick fix and I really wish I hadn't. My chicken sandwich and fries came out to $13.00, sans tip!  That's not a diner price. Why so expensive you ask? Because the bums charge me $1.00 to switch from blue cheese to swiss cheese and $2.00 to add grilled onions. To top it off, there was nothing particularly exciting about this sandwich and the fries were mediocre. Don't get me wrong I have no problem dropping money at restaurants, but I  hate it when my food is overpriced AND doesn't live up to any sort of standard one would deem to be good The staff wasn't  friendly and no offense to my waiter, but his neither his attitude nor his hygiene was up to par.",1
"Ick. Ball of cheese. I went with three friends on a recent trip to Chicago and we all thought the pizza needed more crust, more filling, and more sauce; anything but more cheese! We all left feeling sad and confused- is that really what Chicago deep dish is supposed to be like? I've certainly enjoyed the deep dish I've had in other cities, including San Francisco, much better.",1

"I've like Giordano's for a while now, but I must give this particular location one star because of an incident that occurred just an hour ago. Several of my coworkers and I were working late at my office and we decided to get Giordano's delivered.  I called in and talked to a woman who REALLY hurriedly took my order.  I ordered a large stuffed pizza, gave her my credit card info, and then she very quickly said 'It will be an hour' before hanging up the phone before I could cancel. We figured it was ok, so waited the hour and the delivery guy was right on time.  Unfortunately, he brought a large thin crust pizza (we ordered stuffed).  I called in and the woman paused for a moment (probably realizing that it was almost time for them to go home) and then told me 'no, that's not what you order",1
"I had such a terrible experience with the service at this place that I'm giving them 1 star just to be an a$$hole and do my part to lower their yelp rating average.   The service was so bad that it was actually about 2 years ago that I was there and I'm still mad about it.   I wrote a formal complaint letter and never got a response.  My friend and I were talking about this place today, and she had an even worse experience than I did.   There are better options for pizza in Chicago folks, go somewhere where they treat their customers well.",1
"The concept is great.  The location for me is great,  The food is average and over priced BUT what really gets this one star is the owner.  After giving the owner (I luckily forgot his name) a few chances to change my mind, his consistently horrible behavior to me, my friends, other customers and HIS OWN STAFF have completely turned me off the Diner. His staff cannot stand him (or at least the 2 people who waited on us over a few months and who freely offered their opinion of him).  I have had him scream at me (YES - scream) at the table because I asked a server to check on our order (very politely...and the server was horrified by his behavior).  I have seen him 'remove' customers from a booth and told them to never come back because he didn't like their attitude.....I have also seen him ",1
"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Can I rate it a 0 or a -1??? We sat down for dinner and ordered a bottle of wine with dinner. However I made the mistake of ordering one the beers on the menu and the waiter looked at me like I was barefoot and had food in my teeth. If you don't want people ordering beer then don't put it on the menu. God forbid someone ordered a beer at Everest. I was wondering if they were going to put my picture up on the wall as the first person to ever be so uncouth as to order a beer. Then it took 20 minutes for him to bring it to my table. I don't go to a restaurant to have someone making minimum and tips treat me like a 2nd class citizen. Not to mention the food which was average at best was served in 1/",1
"Travesty of a place. We arrived early on a Friday, like senior citizen early. Two of the three of us were there, and said we were waiting on a third. The place was empty, so we assumed there would be no problem getting a table when our third arrived. And as they said nothing at all about it, we had no reason to believe that the hostesses thought otherwise. So, our third ran late. We were to meet at 4, and 20 minutes go by when we hear the hostess tell someone that there was a 45 minute wait. Thinking that couldn't be right, we walked up to ask, and we were told that yes, there was a 45 minute wait because a large party was coming in. When we asked if we'd only have 25 minutes because we arrived 20 minutes ago, they said that no, it was a 45 minute wait. When we asked why they didn't say th",1

"As this was my first time in Chicago, of course a must try is deep dish pizza. This was our second stop after Lou Malnalti's. First of all, the service was horrible as the server never came to check on us and was nowhere to be found. The pizza also took about 50 mins so we were even more irriated. As for the pizza: Doesn't beat Lou Malnati's! It was too much cheese, the dough wasnt buttery. Bottom line: I wasnt feeling this place",1

"The management here is incredibly rude. Was excited about trying authentic diner food. Went on a Saturday afternoon when the place was more than half empty. Was with an older woman who had a back problem. Her husband let us out at the door and went to park the car. Even though there were plenty of tables, they refused to seat us until the other two people in our party were there. We left. Can't review the food, but the customer service stinks.",1

"I had been to Emerald a couple of times and thought it was a typical, mediocre downtown bar that would be universally loved (as all Irish bars are). I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice! After another attempt to order a drink it w",1

"Worst pizza I have ever eaten in my entire life. The pizza took very long to come out but was cold. The dough wasn't cooked through and the cheese was gobby (the type you choke on).

"We heard the hype of this place. It was recommended by more than a few of our local friends. After waiting for over 1.5 hours, we finally got our pizza, and were floored by how underwhelming it was! Mountains of rubbery mozzarella cheese, no sauce, nothing good, let alone extraordinary! Crust sucked, veggies were soggy and droopy...meat was nothing special.  The tastiest part of the meal was the marinara sauce I had to order to dip me pizza in because there was just no sauce.

"I've been a regular since they opened several years ago but the place is going down hill and I probably won't be back. I usually stop in before work for a coffee and a yogurt.  They used to make their yogurt  with fresh fruit but now use some sort of liquid substance with chunks of soft objects that may look like fruit but taste like sewer matter. I had generally liked the coffee in the past and the fact they have a variety of flavors. Though, I learned early on to never order the iced coffee. They keep a jug full of stale coffee in a fridge and serve it to you in a cup of ice. It's nasty. I also was very bummed out this morning when the cup of pumpkin coffee I received had no pumpkin taste at all but seemed to be some lame generic decaf.

"This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE only: I live across the street from this place and eat here often.  Usually, i just get the pizza for carry out.  I HATE the fact that they want to charge you for gardinaire peppers when their counterparts in the suburbs are so friendly about it.  This place specifically really needs to work on its customer service.  When you're charging 22 dollars for a large stuffed spinach, a small cup of gardinaire isn't going to kill you, and you can't count it as a topping since my g/f only wants it for her slices (2).   Secondly, I ate there last night on a dine in basis, and the service was also horrible.  I left a note at the end that said 'Why your tip stinks' and I listed the following reasons: They never refilled my water.   I asked for gardinaire pepper",1

"Bad in all respects. Went here around 10:00 am.  I ordered a bagel. Cashier did not know if they sold cream cheese?! Then waited close to 15 mins. to get my bagel as no less than 3 people were standing around and 1 guy cooking. They did not toast the bagel, but instead threw it on the grill with eggs being cooked for someone else.  Seemed gross. After I get the bagel and am walking down the street I notice no cream cheese on the bagel. Go back to this dump and they hand me a tub out of the fridge with cream cheese. The City's health inspector was there so people seemed on edge, but come on people, think and do something other than starring into space. Will not return.",1
"Sucks!  Me and my co-worker went here for lunch one day and this was only a pick up order so I'm afraid to see what the inside service is like.   I had the bangers and mash which were ok but not that great.  The onion strings were chewy and the mashed potatoes were cold.  My co-worker had steak and ale pie which was disgusting she actually went to Popeye's chicken instead and threw her lunch out.   When I went to pick up the order I went up to the bar and told them I had an order for pick up.  Instead of asking me something like 'What name is it under?' or 'What number did you call from?'   The bartender acted like a jerk and said 'Can you be more specific?'   I'll never eat here again.",1

"This whole experience just sucked.  There's no other way to say it. I went with a co-worker for a Friday lunch and it sucked from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. First, we stood waiting at the entrance for what felt like forever while servers and bartenders passed us without an acknowledgment.  Apparently the idea of host or hostess never occurred to Encore.  There were two other couples and a group of 4 also waiting and looking a little disgruntled.  Not even a host stand - the bartender came over and seated us and spent the rest of the time acting as host, bartender and our crappy server. After finally seated it took about 10 minutes for him to come back with our drinks and take our order.  This is loop lunch people - I have to be back in my office and your laid back ti",1
"I've been a regular since they opened several years ago but the place is going down hill and I probably won't be back. I usually stop in before work for a coffee and a yogurt.  They used to make their yogurt  with fresh fruit but now use some sort of liquid substance with chunks of soft objects that may look like fruit but taste like sewer matter. I had generally liked the coffee in the past and the fact they have a variety of flavors. Though, I learned early on to never order the iced coffee. They keep a jug full of stale coffee in a fridge and serve it to you in a cup of ice. It's nasty. I also was very bummed out this morning when the cup of pumpkin coffee I received had no pumpkin taste at all but seemed to be some lame generic decaf. WTF?  It will be a long while before I give this pl",1

The worst part was that the next morning, I awoke with severe food poisoning - so bad I had to call for my mom to help me get to the hospital.  When she called the restaurant to see if anyone else had reported symptoms (to try and help diagnose what caused it) they told my mother I mus",1

The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged. I talked to the manager and he said that he did not approved anything and he directly said that we ",1
"This used to be my favorite Pizza stop in Chicago.  Working in the city, I recommend this Giordano's to everyone.  Until now.The pizza is still fantastic, our server was nice.  Not much personality, but nice.  Management is horrible and an embarrassment to any organization.  A friend from England had offered to buy lunch and after dinner he presented a traveller's check to the server.  All seemed fine.  She returned asking for identification.  He gave it to her and she returned later saying that they were unable to take the check.  We asked for the manager and we asked him why he would not take it.  He smeared the reverse of the check which showed it to be valid and his answer was 'We can not take it because you are not from Illinois.'  That was the only reason he would not take it.  We tr",1

"Solid 'meh'. For what it is, it's kind of pricey. The menu doesn't jump out as exciting, and the food was just okay. Nothing special. Fries had no seasoning. Pulled pork was what appeared to be leftover ribs (Cubed - which is not pulled, FYI) with barbecue sauce on top. I don't mean to be a southern or anything, but it just wasn't really good. But the place was packed. Lots of white people. Older white people. I was wondering if they were all tourists, because CLEARLY none of them lived in the loop or South Loop - super suburbanite looking bunch. There are just so many better places to eat for cheaper. Capping it off was some awful service. My friend asked if there were any drink specials. The waitress blankly looked and said 'no'. My friend asked 'do you have a martini you would recommend",2
"Can't really bring myself to come back here -- tomato sauce is an incredibly important part of a good pizza, and theirs is gross.  Given how fattening it is, it needs to really appeal to your most basal culinary desires, otherwise it fails.  This brand doesn't do it for me. I went once with my boss, to give us the opportunity to sit down and talk through some work issues.  Because I knew I wasn't that into the pizza, I decided on the spaghetti, which was overcooked and mushy.  And on top of it?  That sauce.",2
"This was my very first Chicago-style deep dish pizza experience and I gotta say folks, I was not impressed.  The reason you see two stars here are for the following: 1.  The waitress was nice. 2.  The salad that my friend shared with me (thanks) was good. As for the main entree, blah! After about 45-55 minutes of anxiously waiting for the arrival of a true Chicago pie, I couldn't wait for the rest of my friends to get their slice, so I went ahead and bit into my share like a starving mole rat.  Sound the buzzard because this pizza is crap.  Ok, it wasn't greasy and it didn't leave vats of oil on my plate, which is a huge plus, but it tasted like dairy for crying out loud.  That really was my response, 'This tastes like dairy'.  I started to sense my friends were also having similar respons",3
"Exchequer seems like a popular place with DePaul's campus and a ton of offices around the area. I have been here a couple of times with coworkers and I wasn't very impressed with their food. I ordered their fish and chips for lunch but was surprised that the fish was chewy and somewhat dry. This tells me that the fish was severely frozen or overcooked. I've had their house brew dark lager too and it was rather plain. Don't think I will be coming back anytime soon.",2
"Meh.  I feel bad for the young girl who was working behind the counter so I'm giving it two stars instead of one.  She was the lone person behind the counter during the end of the office work day rush.  I came in just before the crowd and ended up waiting for a good long time while she slowly wandered between the blenders and the register area.  I was staring at my blended, just needs to be put in a cup, drink for 5 minutes.  A minute longer and I would have poured it myself.  Once I got the drink (Mango Mantra with Green Caffeine boost)  it was pretty blah and very powdery.  Probably won't go here again unless I see some more people behind the counter.",2
"I've been to Giordano's many times in the past (including this location), but I feel compelled to write a review about my dinner last night just to complain about the 20-minute wait when there were a million empty tables in the back (but I assume it's just because they didn't have enough staff to cover them) and we were seated at a very small, crowded table in the middle of the room. Also, my veggie stuffed pizza had giant chunks of peppers and onions in them, much too big to be on a pizza. The spinach artichoke dip was really good, though. I like Giordano's but if last night was my first encounter, I wouldn't have been impressed.",2
"Not sure if i came on an off day, but i was not impressed. I have eaten deep dish style pizza outside of Chicago and loved it, and this is my first time having it in Chicago.

Sorry Chicago, bad first impression.",2
"Y U NO PUT ENOUGH MARINARA SAUCE IN YOUR DEEP DISH PIZZA?!?! Also, the crust was... hard? My knife was really struggling to get in there and cut you. Don't worry, knife; you are not alone. my teeth also struggled. The cheese to sauce ratio was way off. It's like the gum to tooth ratio. There are some times when you'll lower your standards because hey, you like them enough to look past those superficial 'flaws.' You love their personality. But let's get real, Giordanos, you didn't quite have the personality to allow me to look past your outer flaws. Your pizza personality was nothing special, and your looks were just not doing it for me. Also, I think the waitress was having an off day. I don't know if she was slightly rude or if that was one of your cute little idiosyncrasies you were hopi",2

"I think this is my first 2 star. Not for circuses but more for experience. Gioco's is a nice establishment and kind of edgy. It is in a bustling area of the South Loop that many moons ago, was part of the whole speakeasies and ill repute known to mankind, but that is the gift of the area and to think that businesses are starting to bustle is really a good thing. Also other prohibition-era establishments including Al Capone's headquarters was once housed here. I was invited by my dear friend Jeanette for dinner (who happened to of purchased dinner tickets on SWOOP, its like Groupon).

"I loves me a Vito with mayo and Thinny Chips.  My absolute favorite lunch cheat on Weight Watchers.  Totally worth the inflated prices of JJ's for the bread alone -- finally a sub roll with decent crust and good chewiness in a chain restaurant.     What I don't love is the inconsistency of this location (and attitude!) when I go there in off hours.  Like 2:30 pm-ish today for example.  Kinda wack but it seems like the food and service is way better during the 11 am - 1 pm crowded lunch time.  You're in, you're out, you're on your way.  The order comes out perfect every time.   Not so at 2:30 pm when you are the ONLY person in the store.  Attitude out the yin-yang for wanting two sandwiches (one for me, one for co-worker who loves him a no-onion Vito easy on the mayo) rung up separate.   Sa",2

"Yikes, I thought Miller's was bad. I can't believe that I'm saying this but I think that I'm at the moment in life where you learn to just say no to grease pits or more like I'm saving my greasy indulgence for something that will more then satisfy the craving (like late night Mexican or a hotdog joint). It's places like this, is the reason Chicago is overweight. It has all the fatty foods you can eat, of which they are known best for their ribs and pizza but I cannot attest to them. It has the same feel and almost look as Miller's but with more light. Seats and tables are comfortable and they have a descent bar area. The staff is friendly and hospitable, I just try not to eat at these places if I can avoid it or afford it (yep, downtown prices).",2
"Hearing all the buzz about Chicago pizza coming from Las Vegas, we definitely had to try it and since Giordano's claimed to have the 'famous Chicago stuffed pizza' we gave the restaurant a go. However, be prepared to be waiting; waiting to be seated, waiting to be served, waiting for food. On a Saturday summer afternoon, the place was busy and the temperature was warm. The air was not very refreshing coming from the humid outdoor weather (and coming from Las Vegas where every store has sub-zero temperatures, this was not a good start). Although the wait was told at 35 minutes, is probably only took them 15 minutes to seat. When seated, however it did take another 5-8 minutes for a server to come over. They do warn you on the menu that Chicago deep-dish pizza does take a 30-40 minute wait s",2

After finding a veggie burger on the menu and being assured there would be wireless, I nabbed a table with an outlet by myself and settled in to get some work. Now, here's where I made a rookie mistake: I ordered before confirming there was wireless. Because there definitely wasn't but at that point I had to stay or pay for a meal I didn't eat. Cue anger.

I started with the frozen vodka lemonade - awesome! And then we ordered food - I wanted the Audri (turkey melt!). I asked the waiter what side came with this and he had to go check. This sandwich is $10.95 and comes with NO SIDES. My partner's $12.25 Reuben came with sides. Grrr, at that point I felt like I was being nickel and dimed, especially when the side salad was $6 and is almost 100% iceberg lettuce.

We finally decided what we should order, I did 3 eggs with scallions, crispy bacon, rye bread, side of salsa (extra $1.50) and no potatoes with fruit (extra $1). hard to imagine fruit cost less than salsa but whatever.

Sadly to say, I wasn't entirely disappointed but i wasn't blown away either. It was just a good resturant quality burger. Nothing special. Wait a minute....wow i paid $12 and could have just went to McDonalds and paid half of that for basically the same thing.

When they served the rest of us was when the server asked her if she had a second choice for a bagel, because 11-City was out of rye.

I was in town shooting a short film for a few weeks and the producer insisted on ordering Giordano's because he KNEW it was the best pizza in Chicago, and clearly we all know that producers generally know EVERYTHING. That being said, the pizza itself was somewhat lackluster in appearance, taste and texture. The crust was quite lacking in crispness and flavor, sort of a bland wheat crust that merely held everything together. It had a greasy taste to it as well, like cardboard with canola oil slathered on it.

"I don't get it! Believe it or not, yesterday was my very first experience with Garrett's and I was not impressed! Judging by the long lines I figured it would be totally worth it, but it wasn't at all. The line moved pretty slowly, considering the product and the fact that it is already totally prepared. At one point, a girl came out to refill the cheese popcorn and it was in a giant plastic bag that she cut open...as if it was made in some big factory (was I naive to think it would be made there?...or was it? I dunno). Anyway, I got cheese popcorn and I don't usually complain about things being too expensive, but it was! Oh well, what the market will bear, and all. It was tasty enough, but mixed in with my cheese were random pieces of caramel (no, I did not get the 'Chicago Mix'), along w",2

When our last guest arrived (it was not packed and no lines) we were sat at a table with a reserved sign just for us......why couldn't they sit us? We were all confused. We finally decided what we should order, I did 3 eggs with scallions, crispy bacon, rye bread, side of salsa (extra $1.50) and no potatoes with fruit (extra $1). hard to imagine fruit cost less than salsa but whatever. It was good, not amazing, had fluffier eggs at yolk and meli's.

As I approached the register one of the employees sauntered over from the back of the restaurant. Her heals were dragging so loudly that I giggled to myself.

"Yet another Jerry Kleiner restaurant that fails to impress me; I find Gioco to be overpriced and the food simply average. There are no real standouts on the menu - you'll find the usual Italian offerings: carpaccio, calamari, pasta in a meat ragu sauce, and pizza. I did really like the ravioli di funghi, although Follia, which has since closed, made far better pasta (but suffered from a horrible location). I can actually deal with average Italian food, but what gets me about Gioco are the prices. Simply put, an $11 caprese salad better knock my socks off. We easily spent over $150 on dinner for two and it just wasn't worth it. The outside dining sounds nice, but it can actually pretty loud on Wabash, especially with the El thundering overhead. The waitstaff tends to forget about the outsid",2
"In a word: disgusting This pizza COULD have been good, IF they cooked the effing dough.  Instead what I got was a pizza with a delightfully flaky outer edge, and a bottom that consisted of half cooked dough.  Nothing is as tasty as gooey dough, yum.  And it is 'stuffed' because they put another thin layer of dough over the top.  Then they put sauce on top of that.  So guess what other part of the crust is not cooked at all?  Bingo!  That top layer was so disgusting.  They at least put sauce on the pizza, unlike Lou Malnati's, but their sausage was not as good.  I did not like their chopped salad as much as the Malnati salad either.

Spinach pizza was premade and came right out.  Speed good.  Taste bad.  Not fresh.  Low flavor impact.  Not nearly as good as some of my Bay Area favorites, which was especially disappointing.

I've never eaten 'authentic' Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza and was pretty excited at the prospect. I've always enjoyed thicker crust pizza and from the praises and aesthetic of the Chicago pie, what's not to like. The execution of this beast of a pizza was quite bad by any means. There was just way too much going on, and none of it good. Too cheesy, up to a point where it was hard to eat. I imagine a depp dish crust to be crisp buy yet chewy with a nice give. But this crust had the texture of a cookie / biscotti. Too god damn hard. I'm sure this doesn't represent Chicago pizza as a whole and may as well be one of those places where tourist such as myself go to ex",2

However, I was there last friday night and the waitress was THE WORST.  I believe her name was Andrea...we had a pretty large group of people and in that situation you would expect the server to come by every so often to replace drinks, etc., because large groups of people usually = large tips.  But this waitress only came to our table a few times, we had to get up and ask the bartender for more drinks several times, and there were several instances when we tried to flag down the waitress and she walked straight past us, pretending she didn't hear!!!  I couldn't even b",3

The selection of British beer is impressive and there are 8+ selections on draft.  The food is standard pub fare.  Unfortunately, the kitchen did not have a few of our first-choice appetizers due to the holiday.  Through process of elimination, we settled on potato skins, bruschetta, and onion rings.  Lots of deep fried options.

"When I worked closer to this location, this was our de-facto place to order pizza for parties, or even to visit on a slow day. The problem? I do not care for their pizza, and the menu offers little else that's even remotely appetizing. This location is set up kind of cramped - we couldn't stop bumping elbows wherever we sat. Despite the close quarters, for whatever reason, every server we've had has somehow missed 2-3 people at a big table. Very odd. The thing that killed the outings was when we showed up with a reservation twice in a row, and they couldn't sit us all together - some were in booths, others were at a table in a different room...it was really awkward and irritating. Add to that, we had to shuttle plates of different pizzas to the other people in our party and practically had",2
"I don't get it- deep dish pizza. It's really a lasagna but has layers of bread instead of noodles. And the bread isn't anything wonderful or distinctive- like a San Francisco sourdough, say. The regulars here know that there's a 40 min wait for the pizza to be delivered to the table from the time the order is placed. That's a looong time. I think it's an annoying affectation. You can go to the finest gourmet restaurant and order an item, and it's brought to the table fresh and hot a lot sooner. Think about it. A leg of lamb, a prime rib, an apple cobbler. The restaurant doesn't start from scratch when you order. Giordano's is a cult  and they've got diners believing that the pizza tastes better when they make you wait.

Part of the reason for this is the waitress informed us the cook time for deep dish (DD) would be 35-45 minutes and since our son had never had DD before, he opted to try a peperoni and cheese DD. However, that pretty much puts anyone getting DD at 60-90 minutes minimum, so that explains the long waits and low table turnovers. It also encourages people to order the appetizers which we resisted to keep the bill down. We opted for a thin crust pizza and promptly scarfed it down as we had been walking all day.

"Pancake (plain buttermilk) was dry.  Toast was good and eggs were okay.  I really wanted to like this place more.  The decor was really cute.  I'll give this place a second try and either get the tofu scramble or the french toast that everyone raves about.  I think this place is a little overpriced, especially the drinks.",3
"I love the old-style deli feel of Eleven City Diner, but the food prices are another story. While the portion sizes are somewhat large, the food doesn't feel worth the $30 two people might drop there. The tuna melt I ordered was drenched in cheddar cheese, but otherwise not too terrible. I enjoyed my everything bagel I opted for upon my second visit. The food here is just OK, nothing more, nothing less.",3
"The Emerald Loop is in my office building, so I've spent quite a bit of time here having lunch or grabbing drinks with colleagues after work.  This is a great spot for both.   Some of my favorite dishes include the fish and chips, grilled cheese sandwich, smoked salmon salad, and the chicken sandwich.  A little higher quality than your typical bar food.   They have a great outdoor patio with views of Trump Tower and the Tribune building -- a great happy hour spot if the weather is nice and you work in the Loop.   I hear they have a big St. Patrick's Day celebration - can't wait!",3
"I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could.  The food is decent, I've had everything from the hummus to the shrimp sandwich. My favorites things would have to be the fries and the pizza.  If you're looking for a drinking spot after class (this includes the grad school crowd) it can get a bit packed in the evenings but it's lively.  All in all it's not a bad place for a drink and some decent, if slightly expensive, food.",3
"Giordanos are ubiquitous in the Chicago-land area.  I've been to a couple.  I can't complain about the pizza or the service.  I simply like New York style pizza better.  Not knocking the deep dish thang--I'll certainly eat it, but I prefer a pie from New York.",3
"Epic Burger was not as epic as some people had raved about. My turkey burger was not as greasy as I expected it to be and the taste was pretty good. The fries was one of the best i have had from a burger joint and the smoothie was delicious. I love how simple the menu is. It was definitely worth the coupon i got from Daily Deal Chicago. It's not the best burger but at least it tasted fresh and healthy. Now move over, Five Guys.",3
"I've lost count of how many people recommended this place to us when we told them we were going to Chicago.. we didn't know how we felt about deep dish cheese stuffed pizza but knew we couldn't come to Chicago without giving the famous pizza a taste. They told us it'd be a 45 minute wait and that you could pre-order at the window since it'd take just as long to make the pizza. I definitely suggest pre-ordering while you wait. It was worth it as we were seated at least 15 minutes before we got our pizza. The small pepperoni stuffed pizza was more than enough for two people to share. My thoughts on the pizza itself - holy cheese. I expected a stuffed pizza but the amount of cheese used was overwhelming. I couldn't even cut through the bottom of the pizza with my knife (crust was way too hard",3
"Ehhhhh. I'm starting to wonder if the city can ever actually pull off an authentic Irish bar (see: Ballydoyles in Downers Grove as your template). Most don't even try. Those ones just slap an Irish name on and hang a Guinness poster on the way to the mens' room. The rest quickly devolve into Johnny O'Tooligans Irish Drinking Emporium where the decor certainly says all the right things, but the soul is lacking. Emerald Loop is more of the latter. The decor is certainly nice, but I would see this place as more of a lunch spot instead of a happy hour or dinner spot. The place got loud surprisingly quickly. I'm not sure if that's a function of the music or the crowd, but when I was on the same side of a bar table, and still can't hear the person sitting right next to me, there's a problem. You",3
"Don't judge me for the fact that my reviews of late have been about pizza joints. I eat other things, I swear. So my verdict for Giordano's is---not as good as Lou Malnati's! (But better than Gino's East). I appreciated the pre-order option here (we ordered while waiting, so by the time we were seated we only waited 10 mins before our pizza arrived). But the pizza itself was overwhelming, our mushrooms and olives were smothered by the cheese, and in general it felt like way too much. I realize that deep dish isn't meant to be a 'light meal,' but I feel like Lou Malnati's finds the perfect ratio of ingredients to cheese to crust for a deep dish pizza.",3
"i've loved this place since it opened.  but unfortunately today we had a really crappy waitress, she gave us major attitude for asking for cream, and where our milkshakes were.  it is a little pricey too, so i might be taking a break from here for awhile.  though they do have good bagels.",3
"This is a traditional looking British pub with a good beer selection. I was excited to see that they had Guinness 250 on draft when it first came out during the controversy (it was bad, but it was fun to give it a try). There aren't a ton a bars in this area, so it's nice to have this place as an option after seeing a play in the theatre district. Downsides? The music has been terrible when I've been here. I don't mind techno, but seriously, it's just not appropriate for a British pub like this. Secondly, although the actual bar is nice, the rest of the place has the feel of a Bennegins or similar chain restaurant. Maybe it's the carpeting or something.",3
"I'm giving this three stars because the food is actually pretty good, but not great.  The hamburger is a little messy (ok, I'm a slob), and the fries aren't deep-fried but still are tasty. The shakes are delicious. The place is a little pricey as you cannot possibly get out of there without dropping at least $10 - more if you include a lot of add-ons. I'll go back but only on payday.",3

So here you are looking at my review waiting to see what the hell I'm going to say. You want the truth. Well YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH! (Sorry, been looking for a way to work that into one of my reviews for a while.) So Grace O'Malleys is your more upscale Irish pub where folks go to have a little dranky drank drank or grab some grub.  I didnt like the either/or rule that day, so I did both. Sue me. When you walk into Grace O'Malley's there are probably about 30 high stools where you can sit (probably half at the bar, the other half at tables that seat 4).  My luck being what it usually is, all the seats were taken on this",3

"We just moved to the south loop - and luckily I had a Groupon for this place in my Groupon arsenal. I was put off immediately when they seated us on the lower platform - directly underneath someone else who was eating. At 5:30pm on a Tuesday they couldn't find any other table in the whole place (which was almost completely empty) to seat us. This irritated me to no end since I got to hear Mr. Neighbor slurp his pasta. And our waiter - yuck! Didn't explain the antipasti selections even though we asked. I was somewhat sad that they offered no green salad but we went on to order anyway. After we ordered, we overheard another waiter voluntarily tell his guests that a Cesar salad is always available even though it's not on the menu. I ordered the Cappesante (scallops with spinach/mushrooms) and",3

"I live in New York, but I have always liked Chicago style pizza better.  It's been 11 years since I've visited Chicago, so of course I was going to hit up one of big named places.  You just feel like much more of champ when you eat Chicago style pizza. Back in 1999 I had Pizzeria Uno, before it got really chained out....and came away a fan.  Before NY, I lived in San Francisco and for some reason, there are a decent amount of really good Chi-Deep Dished places like Zachary's in Berkeley, Little Star and Patxi's in San Francisco. There's an Uno in NY, but it is really terrible.  So needless to say, I was ready to tear some Giordano's up! Yes it was still pretty good, but I did feel somewhat disappointed.  I was hoping being in Chicago, eating Chicago style pizza would be end all be all.  It",2

"I feel kinda iffy about epic burger. On the one hand, I like that they had turkey burgers, whole wheat buns, etc. The fries were pretty good (didn't try the shakes - although someone else had and liked theirs.) That being said, I thought the turkey burger was kind of weird. It's very thin and the edges are really really thin. A bit hard to describe, but once you see it you'll know what I mean. I found it to be odd and not terribly enjoyable because of that. Overall, not my favorite place.",3

The beer selection is partially British (well done on that) but whats with the shamrocks? HELLO, shamrocks are Irish!! That makes me mad. But, whatever. Bottom line is that I'd rather eat here than in my own local pub back in England. For booze, its a tough call. I guess the prices are pretty decent and the staff are friendly. I wish my mothers' shepherds pie was as tasty as this places, but hey that's life. As for the 'bang on' slogan?- leave that for the chavs and Londoners please.",3

"Came here for a light dinner and drinks with a vegetarian coworker.  Bad choice for a vegetarian. We ordered a share plate of sweet potato fries, pub pretzels, and veggie spring rolls.  (Don't even get me started on why Irish & British pubs serve Asian food...).  All the apps were pretty meh, but I stuck with vegetarian items to be nice, so maybe that's not a fair assessment. The Big Ben Brownie made up for it, simply delicious. Stella drafts were on special for $5, which was nice. Nice decor and great staff; our server Raheel was always there to ask if we needed anything.  We definitely overwelcomed our stay, but he was nice to check in on us once in a while after dessert. Convenient location; I'll have to give it another try with some carnivores.",3
"I don't like deep dish Chicago pizza.  My friends wanted to try it and we came here because it was close.  I've done the others (UNO and Gino's East) and this was good too.  Again, I'm not a person to rate pizza, but since both my husband and I are anti deep dish, we got other menu items and really liked them.  I got pasta with meat sauce and he got ravioli.  Both dishes were really good and I really like their tomato sauce.  Delicious.  The service was awesome and they have good mints on your way out the door.",3
"I have been to this location twice..once for a private party downstairs and once for after work drinks.  Cheesy holiday decorations aside, this place is a pretty safe bet if you're in the area.  The private party was done very well and they appetizers were super yummy.   They were also able to accommodate a party of 6 with no problem on a weeknight and they have a good selection of beer available.  I tried the chicken quesadillas which weren't the best I've ever eaten but they did the job after two quick drinks.   I would definitely stop back in here to try some of their other menu items.",3
"The blt is delicious and it's what I get over and over again because I love the idea of eating a fat-assed,basically breakfast bacon egg and cheese sandwich, but calling it eco-friendly. They are all greened out, with detailed info about their food sourcing and the corn plastic, which I love. But those bitches are pricey as a motherfucker. Two blts and one order of fries? Um, like $20 - what in the fuck just happened? And this is not like a gastropub with 'ambiance' or anything. It would be much less painful if the service was a lot, lot better. Even with the high prices and some other issues, the food is good enough to cause cravings and keep bringing me back, I just wish they would work out the kinks. Smoothies/shakes are pretty decent, too, especially peanut butter and an almond one.",3
"Pros: Fast service, friendly staff, fresher than subway, cheap delivery, quite a few choices and good chips. Cons: No pickles to put on your sub and you have to buy a ginormous pickle (don't forget to ask them to slice it, or you will be in quite a situation), no wheat buns, not the best quality lunch meat, nothing toasted, not open late enough at this location for those of us that work late or have night classes.  AND they don't have yellow mustard!  What is this, New York?  Please. A-OK is a perfect description of this place.",3
"Gioco is the kind of Italian place that I think was common in Chicago 40 years ago - big servings of stick-to-your-ribs mains, with a little bit of a creative spin on some of the starters and desserts.  There's nothing wrong with that, but for me that style is hard to rate higher than 'A-OK.' We started with a heart-of-palm salad, which was actually really a good salad. But we ordered it split, and even the split portions were honestly too big for one person.  There is such a thing as too much of a good thing. As mains we got the lamb and the pork.  Both were nice, although the portions were just enormous.  I hadn't eaten lunch that day, which is a good thing.  Finally, despite the quantity of food we'd already had, we opted to try dessert.  I had the 'rasberry soup,' and my dining compani",3
"This loft space was transformed into an awesome diner that evokes an air of Jewish New York. From their bathrooms to their booths, 11 City Diner's got flair and kitsch to spare. Uh, if you go to a self-declared NYC style diner, you order the NY items. For dinner one night, I was in the mood for a bagel with cream cheese and a Brooklyn egg cream. The waitress looked at me a little funny when I asked for a chocolate one and said that was the only kind they made. Umm, Vanilla egg creams are really good too. And for the skeptical, there's no egg in it. it's chocolate/vanilla syrup, milk, and seltzer. When I am old and decrepit, I will have my IV drip of coffee replaced with egg cream. yum.

"We live a few blocks from Gioco--easy walking distance-- so end up eating here more often than we would if we lived driving distance.  In fact, I'm not sure how often we'd eat here if it were less convenient.   The decor is typical  trendy--exposed brick walls, high ceilings with all the mechanicals exposed, very loud background noise.  You also run the risk of being seating along the railing, which means that another party is either directly above or below you.  I've wondered why they don't stagger those tables, like theater seats.  Probably they can cram more in this way.  You can also get stuck next to the open kitchen, which is either interesting or annoying depending on your take. Service:  Spotty.  We've had attentive, friendly waitstaff like the girl we had last night.  We've also h",3
"The price is decent, but I always think that I should've selected something else to eat once I start eating.  I keep trying to give this place a try since it is close to work, but, no, I'm just not a fan.  If you are looking for standard, fairly bland sandwiches and wraps (admittedly the guac and chips are a nice perk), this is the place to go.",3
"I'm kinda conflicted here.   Their food is really good, but prices are a little silly (I picked up four sandwiches for myself and co-workers, which admittedly do come with chips, fruit and a fantastic chocolate chip cookie, but it was like $60--for four turkey sandwiches?).  And you pick up orders at the bar, so naturally you feel obligated to tip the bartender as well.  Ouch. The rather oddly redecorated space (think 1969 American 'French Provincial' meets Studio 54) is a little more swank than your average Loop watering hole, yet still friendly (it's not a club with a VIP section or anything), and they do have 'real' tables (booths, banquettes) rather than the usual wobbly tall, tiny bar table things, but is priced accordingly.  Also, because they're technically a 'hotel bar', tax is not",3
"Sign up for the Hop on Off Tour, and get a free sample coupon for here that will give you a sample big enough for a meal!! Their cheddar and caramel mixed bag is pretty tasty, but the caramel is definitely the winner in the battle of the bag. The cheddar is good, don't get me wrong, but it does turn your fingers kind of yellow and the taste of the cheddar just fills you up way faster than the caramel which is maybe a good thing so you don't over eat this stuff ha ha My brother and I couldn't finish our two samples without getting too full or done with the flavor, but it is no wonder this place is so famous in the theater district. The second this place opened that morning, there was already a line of people waiting to pick up bags of popcorn for their offices! And the bags you can buy here",3
"So with much hype, I ventured here for their deep dish.  The menu said a small 10' serves 1-2 people.  Well, that's an understatement. It's good for 3-4 people of avg size.  The pizza was really cheesy but the dough was just blah.  I was expecting more pizzaz from all the hype on their deep dish.  I just felt like I was getting a mouthful of dough towards the crust.  It just didn't live up the the rumors for the price I paid.  You do get a lot for your money but...its a lot of boring food.  If that's what you're after, this is the right place for you.",3

Yeah, I'm a freakin' coffee obsessed nut.

The Group On limited us to one beer a piece and a medium sized pizza.  I was particularly curious to try the Flossmoor Station brew that was listed on the Group On HOWEVER - this Gino's East didn't carry it!  False marketing.  I will have to alert Group On.  And oddly enough, this is the third place in the city that has a Flossmoor Station beer listed on their menu and hasn't been able to produce it for me in a glass or any other form.  Once I was told it was 'lost.'

"Pizza has to be one of my favorite foods. So it's takes a lot to disappoint me in this category. After giving  Giordano's a few tries they have done the impossible by disappointing me. For all the hype this place gets, the pizza did not meet expectations. The tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza was overwhelming and didn't taste fresh. I had to drink a lot of water after my first slice because the bread was so thick and dry. When you bite into it feels like you are just biting through layers. The tomato sauce, cheese, and bread doesn't feel integrated. Their thin crust however was solid. But its hard to mess up a thin crust pie. The wait staff are very nice. Overall the pizzeria is average. I don't sit at home and drool thinking about this place. I would only come back if friends invited me",3

The salads were your normal pizzeria house salads but the pizza was interesting. It has a big old crust and sauce on the top layer, then the cheese is in the middle with all the stuffings (if you get any).  I don't really like crust to begin with I like my pizza super thin and I found it very filling and heavy.

"Beautiful hotel with a modern round bar area for the wine room as you walk in. The flights menu was large & available in whatever combination as wished. The service was friendly & fast. We had a great time in the bar & really enjoyed their selection of cheese, wine & chocolate. Will go back for their eno-versity events on tuesdays!",4
"I can't say I'm a deep dish pizza connoisseur, but the pizza here sure was good. I was in Chicago for a conference, and asked every local I met what place they recommended for Chicago pizza.  Giordano's was mentioned as the place to go almost every time. We almost didn't have time to stop in and try Giordano's stuffed pizza before we left.  But on the morning we were going to go back home, I searched for the closest location to the hotel, and called in an order.  At 10:30 in the morning, the actual restaurant wasn't open yet, but they were able to take my order right then--a definite plus when it takes about 45 min. from order time to eating time.  They were also accommodating to make our medium pizza half 'special' (sausage, green bell peppers, onions, & mushroom) and half cheese since on",4
"Before I even get into the food here, let me first say that to the people that are frightened by the line - you should ORDER FIRST then go and pick it up! I never wait in line here for food. I go straight down the steps - pick up my order and go up the back steps where the you can come up to more seating. Anyway, moving on to the food. Most things that I've tried here are absolutely delicious.  Everything is fresh and made to order. I'm stuck on making my own sandwich from the sandwich board. However, The Vail is great and so is the Chicken Caesar Wrap. The salads are huge and great also.   I highly suggest that people try out this place and like I stated before order before you get there. Their menu is online for printing and it'll make your experience much better! Enjoy!",4
"This particular JJ's really does operate by their motto (subs so fast you'll freak).  It was a regular lunchtime spot for my co-workers and me, and once you have 'regular' status they'll know you by name and have your sandwich waiting basically the second you walk in the door.   Service here is really good especially for a fast food place.  They're all so friendly and have great attitudes, especially the Steve lookalike (of SATC).",4
"my new favorite place!",5
"We stumbled on this place when we were in the area.  It has a cool deli vibe to it, very clean and spacious interior.  I'm a big reuben fan, so I had to go with that to see if the quality of the food matched the qualiy of the decor.  I have to say I was impressed.  Very tasty and very satisfying sandwich, definitely in the top 25% of all reubens I've had.  Will definitely come back here when I'm in the area.",4
"Great food! Stuffed crust pizza was awesome. A little too much dough but great taste and quality! Good prices.",4
"Today at work I am chained to my desk.  No bathroom breaks, no afternoon jaunts, nothing.  It is awful.  When it came time to order lunch, I called Goodwin's - a place in the loop I know will deliver to me, 'the prisoner.'  I almost burst into tears when the lady told me there was a 'minimum order' for lunch deliveries.  I told her I didn't care when it came, but I couldn't possible eat 20 dollars worth of food.  No one else is here to go in on the order. If the phone rings and I don't answer it, it's my head.  She put me on hold.  When she came back, we had a 'sister, I hear you' moment and she said she would tack my delivery on the end of the delivery man's schedule.  SO AWESOME OF HER. Goodwin's is pretty money.  The ingredients are fresh and there are no surprises when it comes to your",4
"Being a burger fanatic, it was only right and a matter of time that Epic Burger and myself became acquainted. Stopped in today for lunch and noticed there are 7 Epic rules on the wall once you get near the register. I am usually good @ following rules so I read them and proceeded to the register to order. I asked the 2 cool brothers behind the counter what would they recommend and they told me 'the Epic Burger combo'. They also told me I could add toppings such as a fried egg and bacon. I definitely added the bacon & eggs along with cheddar cheese (other options were blue cheese and something else). I also had the option of wheat and white bread...I chose wheat. The combo came with fries and a drink which came out to $12. The burger itself was pretty good, but because I had everything you ",4
"This place is pretty good. My gym is right next door, so it's easy to drop in every so often after an after-work workout for a couple beers and dinner-I-didn't-have-to-cook. The beer selection is pretty good, with a good variety on tap along with bottled stuff. They have nicer things like Lindemanns Framboise and La Fin Du Monde, and they also have stuff like Old Style and Schlitz for folks who just want a cheap brew. I have had a burger both times I've been and both burgers were really good. They let you customize it any way you like, with various cheeses, bacon, and a lot of veggies in addition to the usual tomato and lettuce. A couple different sauces as well. The fries are waffle fries, which I also really liked. I've found the service to be pretty good too. I've had really cute female",4
"This is a great after work place, it can get a little crowded so try to get there a little before the happy hour rush, if your boss will let you!!!  They have an excellent irish/english menu.  I love the curry, and shepherd's pie.  They also have great beers, including guinness.  Great atmosphere, and definitely helps you wind down from a long day in the office.",4
"This is our favorite local breakfast spot. It is also nice for a casual weeknight dinner. The food is traditional Jewish deli/ diner fare. I recommend the french toast as well as the Tom Waits (a huge portion of pancakes, eggs, sausage and toast) if you don't mind sharing with a your companion. The bloody mary's are also very good. The only drawback to this place is the overbearing owner and the cadre of cute but incompetent hostesses that work here. This usually comes to play on a weekend in the summer. You may end up waiting 20 minutes while open tables are available - very weird system that they have about seating people. It can, however, be entertaining to watch the owner run around chastising all of the workers. I've seen a couple pretty heated exchanges. All in all, I do recommend it",4
"I was treated to my birthday dinner last month since it was one of the restaurants I've been wanting to try for a few years.  Instead of the tasting menu, we opted to order a few dishes each.  We started with an ounce of the caviar which was so delicious (but really quite pricey).  We then had for starters the clam risotto and foie gras.  I think the fois gras was my favorite part of the meal.   For our main dishes I had the escolar with the mushroom bouillon and my date had the duck and turnips.  My main course caught me off guard because I was expecting a really light subtle dish.  However, it was quite rich in mushroom flavor and almost had a homey-ness to it.  My date thought his duck was 'ok.' For dessert I had the chocolate souffle which I thought was very good.  My date had the alsa",4
"This is one of those places you go to and spend most of your lunch break waiting on your food. When its warm out, the line is usually out of the door. Whenever I have the urge to eat here I call my order in. I wait about 5-7 mins (thanks to the luxury of working not even half a block from this joint) and I walk right on over. Now that I have gotten the bad part out of the way..... The food here is great. I usually get the Key West Tortilla Wrap, which is basically chicken breast, pineapple, cheese, pico de gallo and mayo wrapped in your choice of a flour, spinach or wheat tortilla. They are all good, but I like the Spinach tortilla. All Wraps come with Guac, chips and salsa. The menu is great with lots of salads, wraps and sandwiches to choose from and prices are very reasonable.If your of",4
"We loved the concept, the food and especially the server and chef. Didnt love the prices (think of 3 chocolates for $11.00) but so unique (to us) that we went back twice during our stay. I'd recommend the platter where you get 2 meats, 3 cheeses. It has alot of extras and the chef pairs it with a great wine for you. The location is right in the middle of the lobby of the Fairmont hotel but it doesnt seem crowded even with a large group coming through as they have it partitioned off well.",4
"Awesome Pizza. I've been here but my wife hadnt. She fell in love and she isnt a huge pizza fan (I know, but she's beautiful so I put up with it ;-)). The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the location that they put us. It was too close to the other table and I kept having to move anytime someone got up or when staff cleaned the table. The Pizza was worth the hassle however.",4
"There are two parts to Epic Burger. 1. The amazingly delicious Burger.  It was really one of the best I've had in a long time.  It was fresh, it was juicy, and it was quick.  I got the burger with an egg on it, and that was a very good choice.  The special sauce was also good, and the bun topped off the deliciousness. 2. The kind of really disappointing fries. They were really hot when we got them, and then they quickly cooled off into a soggy mess.  The taste was something to be desired as well.  We got two orders, but when the fries arrived, we could have easily shared one order. It was really cool to have cups that were biodegradable, and the staff was nice, even though I had no idea what to order for the first 5 minutes.   The Staff and the burger outweigh the fries.   Probably will go",4
"as far as the area goes, Eleven City is probably the best diner food. Its kitschy Jewish grandma feel pretty much works for someone like me who is searching for a deli/home fashioned meal type joint with reasonable prices. The service is mixed, I've encountered young ladies to be divine waitress' while had an old disgruntled male who was far from what I wanted in a server. it's a toss up but I suggest sitting at the bar if you can bare the cramped space. the french toast is where its at. problems with eleven city: no deal on a dozen bagels. they charge over a dollar per bagel, which is absurd. really.",4
"I really enjoyed the thin-crust pizza here, washing it down with a Newcastle Brown Ale.  The service can vary immensely, between overfriendly, rude, and just right.  The casual atmosphere is very inviting, as well as the price.  Maybe I'll try the Deep-Dish when I go back.",4
"Came here before leaving Chicago. Since we had tried Lou Malnati's, we wanted to check out Giordano's to compare. The crust at Lou's is delish, but the fillings at Giordano's was better. We got there early so getting a table wasn't an issue. Overall, you can't really go wrong, melted cheese on a thick golden crust. YUM!",4
"Took a minute to find this place (back in the corner behind a building off Michigan Ave) but it was suprisingly quick and full service for a downtown pizza place on a Friday night.  Seated much faster than expected and also got the pizzas faster: ordered 2 larges which fed us not only that night but also another night! (4 hungry people)!.   But my biggest regret was ordering the friend appetizers which just about killed my appetite before the pizza arrived, and in retrospect so much  more bland than the pizza that I wish I didn't order it at all.   The deep dish crust is amazing, I wish they would sell that alone and I would eat it plain.",4
"I  thought I would give Epic a try, I work just down the block.  A bunch of my co-workers and I checked it out.  I ordered a Portebello burger for $5.99.  Huge mushroom on a Delicious whole wheat bun, good Epic special sauce, normal burger fix ins and add Wisconsin cheddar for .89.  a bag of hand cut fries is $2 but is huge and can easily be shared.   I loved my burger, very tasty.  Fries were good too. All meats are naturally raised and they seemed to care about the environment (disposable silverware that was corn based and bio degradable ) but the recycling can was no where to be found..hmmm Over all my co-workers and I enjoyed our burgers and they were Epic in proportion.  I will go back and split a burger and fries!",4
"I've been here a bunch of times with family. Food comes out the kitchen fast and is tasty and plentiful. Staff is really nice. Home-y atmosphere. Reasonable prices. I only bumped off a star because my boyfriend said the spaghetti was a bit tasteless.",4
"Order: Regular sized Twist[chocolate and vanilla] frozen yogurt Add Mochi Total: $3.33 It's a nice serving. Heavier and not as healthy tasting as fro yo, but still tastes good.",4
"Recently my friend and I ordered Giordano's.  My friend made a big fuss about it so I was expecting the best.  Giordano's lived up to the hype.  Delicious stuff crust pizza without a doubt the best stuffed crust I have had in the city.  It took awhile for the pizza to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  Also we had enough leftovers to eat for the rest of the day.  I must for anyone looking for good pizza in the city of Chicago.",5

"Whenever I get a burger craving, I like to hop on the red line to Epic Burger because the burgers are consistently yummy.  The patties have crisped edges, and they also toast the buns.  Toppings are pretty simple: lettuce, tomato, onions (grilled or raw), pickles, and special sauce.  Just a great tasting no-fuss burger with the right amount of toppings that don't overwhelm the meaty taste.  Extra add-ons are bacon, fried egg, and cheese (havarti, cheddar, blue).   Also, they use biodegradable cups and utensils!",4
"Let me start by saying the stacked wine separating the two dining areas are really unique and even though we set at a small table it was still very nice. I enjoyed the quaint atmosphere. I felt like I was sitting in a little bistro it was really nice. The menu is very well rounded we partook on several different items. (is partook a word?) Oh well!!!     Mussels were so good!!!! Soup Du jour was a palm leave whipped lobster bisque it was phenomenal. Ravioli stuffed with Mushrooms were very good as well. The pasta tasted as if it was home made and the mushrooms so so fresh. I really enjoyed it and our waiter was absolutely wonderful. I wish I would have made room for the desserts because from what I could tell they looked and smelled wonderful!!",4
"My family 'popped' into town from Texas.  Since they were coming in from the Millennium Park train station, I found this tiny Giordano's on Yelp!  Who knew that this tiny location even existed?   The hostess was super accommodating to our group that grew in size and was then 20 minutes late.  Our pizzas took awhile but that is deep dish for ya.  I wish that they would have come around to ask us about dessert a bit earlier: I always make my nieces and nephew get some delish cheesecake while they are in town.  When they brought it out, I had to ask for the check immediately so that they wouldn't miss their train. I would definitely come back!",4
"One of the downtown outposts of a Chicago institution!  They'll give you samples if you ask... and it's all good! The ones with nuts are sweet and decadent (and they come in nicer bags), and the Chicago mix is unbeatable (and makes a great gift for someone picking you up from the airport!) The fact that the sports tins are $3 more is pretty ridiculous.  Otherwise, it would be 5 stars easy!",4
"I love this location! There are a few more Giordano's in the Chicagoland area, but this one is the best in my opinion. Pizza is always made the way I love it. Deep dish is the way to go. You're in Chicago for goodness sake! Service is relatively good, so can't complain!",4
"Taste: 4 Value: 4 Service: 5 Looking for a place to eat in walking distance from my hotel turned out more challenging than expected. The first couple of placed I found on Yelp were all closed. I ended up on Michigan choosing Giordano's over Chipotle. At first I was interested in getting the 'world famous' stuffed pizza. After the fine print pointed out the 35 minute cook time, I had to move to something that would be ready faster. I asked the waiter for a recommendation after narrowing it down to a few choices. He suggested   Chicken Oreganato, which was on my short list, and I decided to give it a try. I also go the Italian Wedding soup. The soup turned out pretty good (4). It was not made fresh for me, but the meatballs were still juicy and flavorful while the pasta was just right. I was",4
"From street view this establishment elicits an underwhelming impression.  The oversized letters and neon signs remind me of another installation of Jimmy John's.  It actually took a recommendation by a bartender in Cleveland, OH for me to give it a try.   The interior is a whole different experience - a glorious upscale hipster diner...er Jewish Deli.  Whatever you want to call it, the atmosphere and staff is pleasant and accomodating.  Although the food is somewhat traditional, the taste is anything but ordinary.  The Corned Beef and Pastrami Hash was as good as any I have had in this genre, but the Mexican Scramble is a dish good enough to get every time.  If you're a carrot cake fan, this is a 'perfect' rendition.   Would have given this 5 stars, but they need to add an extra server at ",4
"I've been to Giordano's once before on a previous ND vs. USC trip, and the second time around was just as good.  It was a different location, but just as good as I remembered. When the server suggests an appetizer because the pizza takes a while to cook, take the advice.  We were hungry as we walked in, but we did not take the server's appetizer advice.  We sat there for some time before changing our mind about the appetizer - it was a great call.  Within a few minutes after munching on our appetizer, the pizza was out. The pizza is dense and it's filled oh-so-yummy goodness.  YUMMY!  I can't wait til this Fall for another ND football game weekend. Good stuff.",4
"The deep dish pizza was great! As other people have said it does take about 35-40mins for pizza to arrive, but I found this tone a great time to sit and converse with friends!Will be going back again.",4
"This is a great loop lunch spot if you're in the area.  Their menu is such that everything they serve comes out pretty quickly...  You can be in and out in no time, assuming you don't have to wait for a table.   I really really like their muffaletta sandwich.  I also like their beef brisket.  Their homemade fries are great.  And every day they make fresh hot chocolate chip cookies.  Ask for one and you shall receive--free.  But they run out of them so don't go too late or they'll be out. I've gone a few times for martinis after work, they were always good and strong.  They occasionally have happy hour type specials (1/2 price appetizers, etc.).",4
"Everyone has their preference of deep dish pizza.  I personally liked Gino's better but just slightly.  Both are very very good places to get a pie.  Just a heads up, I ordered pineapple and instead of baking it inside, it was put on top.  I was a little disappointed about that.",4
"Great neighborhood spot that we will miss now that we've moved out of the South Loop. It gets a bit crowded on Thur-Sat nights after 8:00, but, never becomes intolerable. The no smoking law in Chicago makes it even better now in the bar. Good food, good drinks, good staff. Maria is great!",4
"My buddy Brian, transplant from NY state who lives in the Chicago area, took me here for lunch after a cool tour of Millennium Park. The pizza was GREAT. Never had authentic deep-dish before so I was quite impressed. And like a moron, I tried picking it up w/my hands like I'd been conditioned to do all my life & found that a knife & fork are essential.",5
"Great place for pizza. And a pretty good location, too. Be careful not to order too much. A couple slices are almost too much. The service at this location seems to be very odd. The first time we went, we waited for 40 minutes just to get drinks. And then another 40 for the pizza (and I know it takes a long time to cook). Another time, one of the waiters (not ours) kept staring at us and I'm still not sure why. It doesn't matter though. Its great pizza. (Just order the deep dish cheese and you'll be happy)",4
"Plus - they take reservations, the decor is pretty nice, and it serves all different kinds of foods - Parmesan fries, sundaes, salmon burgers, you name it. Minus - it's gosh-darn-loud in there! We got there a little after 7 on a Friday night and it was already pretty full and the music was extremely loud. It's nice if you're sitting next to each other, but if there's a large group of you, you might not be able to hear everyone. If someone would promise me that the music wouldn't be so loud next time I go, I'd definitely come back. Otherwise, I'd pick somewhere else if I want to have a conversation.",4
"Went to Eleven City on a day off for an early lunch.  Let me tell you, I love Jewish delis!  My friend and I were lucky to come in before the lunch crowd because this place gets busy fast.  I had a blood mary which peppery and spicy with flavor, however when the bill cam I was a bit surprised of its price tag.  I ordered Soup & 1/2 Sandwich.  Obviously I had to try bubbie's matzah ball soup - the ball was large and filled with flavor along with a pastrami 1/2 sandwich that I put on Challah (my favorite kind of bread.)  The pastrami was mouth watering delicious!!  My friend had the lox flavor and it looked marvelous!  It must've been amazing because she ate the whole thing!  Since we 'checked-in' we got a sample of homer's ice cream - strawberry & mint chocolate chip - both were a treat!  I",4
"Epic Burgers are made with organic ingredients and taste amazing!  They're a little on the greasy side but excellent nonetheless!  The fries are great as well.  The price is also great too!  In addition, try their grilled chicken burger.  It's actually quite good and I have switched from eating their beef burgers to their grilled chicken burgers.  It's located in the heart of some colleges like DePaul and Columbia so you will get a lot of students there but it's never been an issue since I've started eating there.",5
"Glad a new lunch spot opened up but I won't be going back anytime soon.  It's not that the subs aren't good, I just don't like them.  I'll give them four stars because the subs are of decent quality and they're big but, contrary to the 4 star reveiw, I'm not a fan.   To end on a high note - I placed an online order, got there and still had to wait for my sandwich - they threw in a free drink so that's two thumbs up.",4
"Came here on someone else's dime (vendor event!) and they had the whole place rented.  Awesome decor, plenty of space to stand and sit, and deliciously strong drinks in giant glasses (awesome).  Really nice staff, too.  Not pretentious at all. Finding a cab is a bitch afterwards, so walk back to the loop or call for one.  Otherwise, you'll be waiting for a while.",5
"I went here for the first time today to watch the NCAA tournament and I was impressed.  They have plenty of TV's to watch games on, and they have lots to choose from on the menu.  I had the chicken caesar salad which was really good and the rest of the food looked pretty good as well.  It's a good option for a lunch in the loop or to grab a few beers after work.",4
"What is there new to say about a Jimmy Johns? Basically they've reached their upper limit, so the only reason to say anything bad about JJs is if there's something sub par compared to every other JJs in the world. There's nothing sup par for this one. I am amazed at how fast these guys can throw together a sandwich, though, but that's there job right? So I guess it's nothing that impressive. There's an older lady that works here which is incredibly un-JJs like to me. So that's cool to see if you come here! Only one set of doors to the outside can make it cold when it's cold, if you're eating-in. That's pretty much it. It's Jimmy John's. You get what they advertise and this place follows through.",4
"This is definitely a great spot to watch a game.  My husband and I went there to have dinner, grab a few beers and watch the game.  We really liked this place because there were tv's everywhere- we can literally watch the game from every angle.  Although we sat at a table, it was very cool to see that each booth had its very own tv as well. The food was pretty good and they had a wide selection of beer.  The ambiance was fun and energetic; and the music was great.  In addition, the service was attentive. Last but not least, I really like that there is ample parking (pay for parking on the street, or $6 dollar parking lot around the corner). Going back soon!",4
"Talk about a SOLID burger! And I say that referring to the quality just being all around good.  I couldn't think of another adjective other than solid...but it just can't be solid because I would picture it as being super heavy (weight and stomach-feeling wise).  And when everything is as organic and fresh as Epic's ingredients, there's nothing truly heavy about it. -Juicy '100% fresh chunk, all natural beef' (not taken out of the freezer and needing the cook to peel off a piece of wax paper off) -Bun that's delivered daily from local bakeries (so soft your fingers leave  finger indents) -Local veggies (yep that lettuce, tomato and such don't travel through 8 states before making it here) -The ingredients are organically natural: Wisconsin cheese makers (gotta love our northern neighbors),",4
"Good deep dish pizza. Blown away by how filling it is. An associate and i ordered a medium and the honest waiter told us that would be too much food and encouraged us to order a small. We did and there was still one piece left. That honesty was nice. The pizza was great, service was great (and it was right in the middle of dinner), plus the beers were very reasonably priced, especially for this area of Chicago.",4
"Giordano's isn't exactly deep dish but it is my favorite non-thin crust pizza in Chicago.  Unlike Uno's, all Giordano's pizzas taste the same no matter which location you go to.  So nice to know it is always going to taste good! The problem with the pizza is that I can never have more than 2 pieces.  But lucky me that I always have leftovers the next day.",4
"After hearing a bunch of my east coast friends rave about this place, I figured it was time to try it for myself. I probably made a poor decision with the buffalo chicken wrap after seeing the amazing looking sandwiches. The meat was all sliced fresh and they did a pretty good job of keeping the huge lines moving. My wrap was above average, but it's nothing that I would go out of my way to get. The person I was with ordered the turkey wrap and he said it was 'the best wrap' that he has ever had. I'll be back to try one of the fresh sliced subs and I have a feeling that I'll be adding another star to my review.",4
"I am totally in love with the turkey burger from here, it is the best I ever had. I have to stop myself from going in here everday when I have school. All the ingredients are fresh and organic and it taste so delicious its addicting! I have had the fries a few times, which are good as well, but the price of the burger alone is expensive, sometime they give a student discount so be sure to ask if you have your id on you!",4
"Awesome Pizza. I've been here but my wife hadnt. She fell in love and she isnt a huge pizza fan (I know, but she's beautiful so I put up with it ;-)). The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the location that they put us. It was too close to the other table and I kept having to move anytime someone got up or when staff cleaned the table. The Pizza was worth the hassle however.",4

"Ok, first off my burger loving ass whimped out and ordered the junior burger.  I don't know what made me doubt my powers - but I definitely could've handled the regular.  Anyways, I dug the fact that I had a real good burger for lunch, but one that had fresh ingredients and an eco-friendly twist to it.  You know, so I can tell myself I'm actually doing my body good by eating a big ass burger for lunch every single day.  Better yet, I dug how the girl taking my order answered every single moronic newbie question I had, and I basically ended up with a made to order burger delivered to my table in about five minutes.  Oh, and ample lunchtime seating and having the IFC on didn't hurt either.  Although I doubt I'm gonna really want to seriously rock a $10 lunch everyday, I definitely will throw",4

"I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but ultimately settled on 4 because I don't have much to compare my deep dish to.  The last time I had Chicago deep dish was about 10+ years ago.  Anyway.... We showed up a little after 6 on a Sunday evening Labor Day weekend.  Busy.  45 minute wait for 2 people.  But we spied 2 spots at the bar and took those instead of waiting for a table.  Best decision ever. The bartender was AMAZING.  He was so fun to watch, quick to respond to drink requests and so accommodating to the table drink orders as well as those of people waiting for tables.  He was one of the highlights of the meal, seriously. The pizza was delicious.  We got the SMALL special stuffed, it was MORE than enough for my boyfriend and I, and we took home 2 slices for leftovers.  As I continue to ",4

Too bad they don't have absinthe....or do they? Actually i have no idea.",4
"Beautiful place.  Wonderful, rich ambiance.  Suede curtains pulled back to reveal the door. Exposed brick.  Great wine list. Lovely Italian restaurant.  Went here for my birthday, told the waiter, and they didn't do anything special.  Meh... you can never know. The food was nice, rich.  I liked the ambiance better than the food, actually.  But, they do have some creative dishes and I would go again.  Our waiter was a little aloof.  Maybe he was trying to give us our space, but we had to flag him down to order our meal after we were done with our appetizer.",4
"Deli (Boar's Head) sandwiches, Hero's, Panini's, Wraps, Soups & Salad Bars, also serving fresh made Sushi and three stations of Hot & Cold Bars. Buffet style area at $5.29-5.75/pound. Your meal can get expensive, easily, be watchful of the quantity you take. Buffet includes Ribs, noodles, fried rice, few Korean dishes, Chinese, American, bbq meatballs, fried chicken, Cajun chicken, etc.  All drinks are all bottled, water in cups provided free. Food is tasty and not very heavy. Not very much traffic inside, I'd say most of the clientele are female, just because of the advertisement outside, it seems to be a Veggie friendly (salads)establishment. (That said.. some of the hottest women in the financial district can be found here.) Breakfast served 6:30am, major CC's accepted. Good food withou",4
"This is our favorite local breakfast spot. It is also nice for a casual weeknight dinner. The food is traditional Jewish deli/ diner fare. I recommend the french toast as well as the Tom Waits (a huge portion of pancakes, eggs, sausage and toast) if you don't mind sharing with a your companion. The bloody mary's are also very good. The only drawback to this place is the overbearing owner and the cadre of cute but incompetent hostesses that work here. This usually comes to play on a weekend in the summer. You may end up waiting 20 minutes while open tables are available - very weird system that they have about seating people. It can, however, be entertaining to watch the owner run around chastising all of the workers. I've seen a couple pretty heated exchanges. All in all, I do recommend it",4
"This place should be paying me because I am constantly dragging people there with me, telling friends about it, hyping it up. It's right by my work and I cannot stay away. I have been to both locations and they are both equally awesome. This place is what fast food should be. They are about as close to being organic and sustainable as is possible and I applaud them for it. All in all, I am a BIG fan! The only reason you don't get 5 stars is because the beef isn't grass fed. That would put you over the top and until then this is my form of protest.",4
"Only place I've ever been to in Chicago for Pizza as I was only there for two days on business and didn't get a chance to try any other places. I thought it was delicious! I even brought two slices back to Philadelphia with me :)",4
"Tiny, charming, Americana-diner in the heart of South loop. A lot of the menu here is Jewish-style - probably a typical menu you would find at a typical New York Jewish diner, like Katz.  Eleven City has the similar flair as the Katz in New York, but the actual food isn't.  Anyone nostalgic to the New York scene would love it here. I tried the Reuben sandwich during the lunch hour at a bar seating.  The food was delicious, but it could have used a bit thicker rye bread.  The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed; the waiting staff lets the customers take their time.  I've seen several customers reading books or newspapers while they ate. This is about the only 'decent' diner in the entire Loop area.  If anyone knows of any other, please suggest...",5
"Whoa.  Now THAT's a pizza.   We went here on our first night in Chicago mostly because it was fast, easy, and near our hotel, but also because - as much as I hate to admit it - we were being cute and touristy.  In any case, Giordano's didn't disappoint.  We were seated promptly and got our pizza (and beers) quickly, given that we'd pre-ordered while we were waiting for a table.  The server was great, friendly and quick, and the pizza was just....well, the ultimate artery clogger.  I usually eat pretty healthy, so my stomach hated me for this one, but it was so worth it.",4
"This was always a nice place to go before a three hour class or for parties. They have a decent selection of things to drink (though I've heard their Guinness is nothing to write home about). The pizza wasn't bad. I've been spoiled by Transfer in Milwaukee, but I really liked the hummus. It was some good stuff, although they give you a lot. The problem is, there's not always room at the bar, so if you just want drinks, you're not welcome to sit beyond the bar. To do so would attract the evil eye from whoever's waiting on you. You've been warned.",4
"Very accomodating to a bunch of post Lollapalooza drunk kids (us).  All we did was order pizza really, but between that and the awesome service, it was winning all around.",4
"This is my second review in as many days. Since their deep dish pizza made me a believer, I couldn't resist trying their ribs. Actually I had their BBQ ribs and chicken wing combo with waffle fries. Years ago I had ribs from Carsons and I was disappointed because they were not fall off the bone. Well the ribs at Exchequer did not disappoint. The ribs were fall off the bone. And although the BBQ sauce was tasty, I have had better ribs before at Smokey Joes in Aruba.  Still they were much better than Carsons. Now for the wings. They were dry wings, not buffalo like I am used to with a side of blue cheese.  These slightly larger than usual wings came with a side dish of the same BBQ sauce as the ribs. Come to think of it, it's probably better then mixing with blue cheese, but by the end of my",4
"If you want a deep dish Chicago style pizza. This is one of the better ones. If you aren't into deep dish, then this is not a place for you.",4
"I come here nearly every day for a breakfast bagel and cream cheese.  The staff gets easily overwhelmed because the ordering system needs some adjustments, but they work hard and at least twice a week I leave a $1 tip. However, I find the $4 minimum totally annoying.  While apparently such minimums are (as of recent legislation) no longer illegal, I think they are a bad policy when you have a daily customer who pays cash day after day.  Only twice in almost a year of going to Jaffa bagel every weekday morning have I asked to use my debit card for the $2 transaction.  This morning, the reason I only had $1 in my wallet was because I gave Jaffa bagel employees a $1 tip yesterday! The manager readily accommodated my request this time, but the counter employees seemed flustered by my request t",4
"We came here to experience Chicago Deep Dish Pizza - and experience it we did!  Yumyumyum!  I am not much of a pizza lover but I most definitely had love for this amazing pie!  It is a lot like pie actually - it takes 40 mins to get your order but it is well worth the wait!  We got pepperoni & mushroom stuffed pizza - so good!  This made Chicago feel like Chicago to us!!",5
"Had lunch here on a Friday at 11:30...there were only a few people in line when we arrived, but as we left at 12:15 pm it was PACKED and the line went up the stairs. I had roast beef and cheddar and it was EXCELLENT, my bud had some other sandwich....plus a bag of chips and two rootbeers for $20.95. Great meal and comfortable place to have a chat!",5
"CHOMP. As you can see from my profile picture, I like Giordano's.  I've reviewed a handful of restaurants on yelp, but this has been a favorite of mine for quite some time. They're deep dish is easily the best I've ever had, although I've heard of a few classic Chicago chains lurking out there that I have yet to sample.  Still, Giordano's pizza is a mouth-drooling gigantic slice of epicness presented to you on a metal platform as if it knows just how good it is.  The Italian in me I'm pretty sure was beating up the Belgian in me when I first saw the slice in all it's glory.  Top it off with some grated parm, and your good to roll. The service isn't great, but that's almost traditional when it comes to Pizza.  In New York you get insulted when ordering the floppy, in Chicago you get ignored",4
"Okay, you must also have a piece of cheesecake...yum!  and I would say also the Matzo Ball Soup. ;)  Oh, and the chocolate cake...way delish.",5
"Great stuffed Chicago-style pizza! One of my favorite pizza restaurants.  Consistent quality and service.",5
"I'll have to round this one up from 4.5 on the strength of the pizza.  I'll get the bad news out of the way first as there was some confusion upon seating my friend and I initially and it did take the waiter a little bit to initially help us, but after that, he was on the ball no problem. Pizza was THAT good, I was floored.  I struggled to get 3 pieces down on an empty stomach (course a few beers beforehand didn't help).  Great, great flavor, could have been a bit more sausage in there, but that's okay, I can give that a pass. It's a lengthy experience as they do take their time making the pizzas, so give yourself some extra time just in case.",4
"Dude I was in Chicago for only like 5 days.  I went to a couple pizza joints and this place was the illest!   We had the most rad righteous pizza here, all you haters, come on now, just cause you had to wait long don't got nothin' on the pizza!   The feelin' was there, the vibe was fun and crowded and the pizza was on point for sure.  The deep dish....oh their deep dish, I guess I could go on and on about how it saved my life but you are just gonna have to check in. I spec the locals know a thing or two aboot pizza, but for us out-of-townies Giordano's is like finding a suit case full of money in a ditch near your house.",5
"This place is 'off the chain' as they say.  This place gets crazy at lunch time so you have to go early.  The wraps here are awesome, second best to Garden Village.  They will put anything in the wrap that you request and props to the slaw that accompanies the sandwich.  The place is a decent size it just gets packed so it doesn't seem that big, yet the line moves relatively fast.  Hot spot for any looper looking to get their mid-day munch on.",5
"I almost moved into the neighborhood just because of this place. Jewtopia! It was the closest to true New York Jewish style deli that I've been to outside of NY. Food was authentic, staff was friendly, atmosphere was fun and inviting. They have an old school soda fountain and a full bar. Homemade everything too. A little pricey but completely worth it. Do yourself a favor, eat at Eleven City Diner. Take a trip to the South Loop just for this.",5

"This pub holds a special place in my heart!  Mainly because I studied in London and Elephant & Castle was one of the stops on the Tube.  It's a little cheesy to say so, but it's true! I go here strictly because it reminds me of London... well, as much as it can.  I've only sat at the bar but every time I go here it's great.  It's not your typical party bar obviously, but it's just a quaint little pub where you can sit and a have a beer after work (or in the afternoon!).  I always get Strongbow when I'm there... it's kind of expensive but it's a cider beer so that is to be expected.   I've always had good experiences as far as service and everyone I take there loves it.  I'll have to check out the food next time I go!  But if you just want to sit at the bar with good company and good people",5
"Wow, bombalicious pizza, man! That's how I remember the Giordano's pie. The pizza is super thick, and baked tall like cheesecake. Layers and layers, like lasagna baby! I've tried pizza in: Italy...super thin, crackerlike crust Da Left Coast...hate it Regularly now in New York City...average pizza joint has 'bout 1/2 inch or so crust But the hype I heard iz Giordano's is da bomb for Chicago T-H-I-C-K style pizza...yo, belee da hype Yo, if this joint were to plop a shop in Manhattan or just about anywhere else in New York City, it'd be instant success! Gimme a shout out, if any of y'all know a pizza joint like Giordano's in New York City.",5
"When people talk about Chicago style deep dish this is the place that you want to come. I lived just north of Chicago for about a year and I would travel about 1 hour by train and walk there almost every weekend or whenever I got the chance.The pizza is phenomenal my  buddies would have a little challenge going to see who could eat the most; needless to say he ended up finishing a medium by himself.",5
"Best pizza in chicago!!",5
"I love popcorn and have been craving this since I first had a taste of Garrett's popcorn.  I usually just stick with the cheese and caramel one. Unfortunately, this place closes a little early for me. I think around 8pm. I flew into Chicago for Business and we couldn't find a Garret's....we just decided to chow down to a good dinner. Fortunately there's a Garrett's inside ORD at the United terminal. I grabbed a couple of bags and the popcorn was good for a couple of days. yummy!!!",5
"YUMMMM!!!  man, I've never tried crack, but this is how I'd imagine crack to be like.  HIGHLY addictive, always wanting more even though you know it's not the best for your health. I got the cheese and caramel mix....stoner's dream: sweet and salty!  I don't know that it's really unhealthy, but I can't imagine something this delicious being good for you.  So fresh, so good!  Go get some today!",5

"You know when you're in a bad mood or had a crappy day and you just need to find your 'happy place'? That is Eleven City Diner for me. I fell seriously in love with this place, pretty much before I even walked in the doors. After hearing that they have excellent Jewish diner food I checked out their website/menu and I was sold. When my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate Valentine's Day I said, 'I want to get a reuben sandwich at Eleven City Diner'...that's just the kind of girl I am. Ever since that evening I have come back multiple times bringing everyone with me (including out of towners and my family in from the burbs). As soon as you walk into the place you can't help but smile. It feels like a retro diner with random Jewish items all around like paintings of rabbis an",5
"Eleven City Diner is a must stop, whenever I visit Chicago.  It is always a good cure for what ever ails you. This half deli, half diner seems family owned because the owner (Brad) is always near by to check in and say hello.  I am amazed at how he always remembers me, even though I am only there a few times a year, at most.  Very passionate about what he is doing and his customers. I even met his mom once. Nice touch ;) You can taste the LUV that goes into the food.  Fresh, HUGE portions that are oh so hot and yummy!!   They offer breakfast all day, fantabulous bloody mary's, and a massive menu of all-american comfort food   The boyfriend, always orders the pastrami.  It is piled high on a number of the menu items and is always enough for two. Their Challah is homemade and fresh.  They us",5
"HANDS DOWN, THE BEST POPCORN EVER. And I don't even like popcorn!  Thanks to Chicago Trolley and Double Decker Co., my family and I each received a free bag of Caramel and Cheese popcorn.  When someone recommended the Caramel and Cheese, I was really skeptical since I don't like caramel.  However, it's the perfect mixture!  Pop in one of each at the same time, and it's a great combination of sweet and salty.  SO GOOD.  Definitely worth the stop if you're ever in the area.",5
"Epic burger is a little pricey for my taste...$10 for a burg, fries, and a coke seems like a little much to me [to be fair, I am living mainly off of student loans, which means all of my money has this 'highly fictional' feel to me, and my brain is frantically calculating, 'tendollarsnowtimessevenpercentinterestcompoundeda­nnuallyfortherestofyourlifecomesouttoa$337­dollarmeal.'] but that's neither here nor there... Let me preface this by saying that I tend to get overly excited about all food. I am far from a harsh critic, and tend to float along in a pleasant haze of satisfaction rather than keeping my eyes peeled for the slightest hint of disappointment. But these guys make a damned good burger...and their fry-makin' guy is no slouch either. Some places do innovative combinations really ",4

"I know I know, I'm usually a bit too generous with the stars, but this location gets some kudos for the service. I'll explain in a moment. We randomly picked this place because we were wandering around das Loop in the rain and we needed food and a dry environment. Even though it was busy, we were seated right away, and the host was nice. The food was good! Comforting chain food. Two out of three of us had burgers, I had the fish and chips, and the lame one with us had a turkey sandwich (where's the sense of adventure in a turkey sandwich?). We're the kind of people to sample each other's food, and it was all good. Here's a heavy suggestion: ORDER THE SWEET POTATO FRIES. THEY ARE THE WIN. But that only qualifies this location for four stars. The FIFTH star goes for our waitress. I'm kicking",4
"I really love this place.  I've never actually been to the location as we always have it delivered to our office.   The sandwiches are consistent and delicious.  They're also really good about getting my super picky orders correct (I usually get the Corvallis on multi-grain bread - no tomatoes, and dressing on the side.). As far as I know their delivery range is pretty small, but they always accommodate a delivery to my office (at Jackson & Wacker) as long as there's a few sandwiches in the order. They are a little bit on a pricey side I suppose ($7 for the sandwich and a small side of chips, fruit, potato or pasta salad), but the sandwiches are excellent (MUCH better than a Subway or Potbelly's sandwich) so it's well worth it to stop by here every once in a while.",5

"First of all, I need to thank my friend Eli for recommending this place. When I told him I was going to try another restaurant, he insisted I go to this spot. I am so glad I finally listened. Thanks Eli!!! I have no idea what kind of sauce they use on this pizza but it is really really good!! Very cheesy and just all around great!! I recently visited Chicago and was recommended this pizza place. I actually ate this delicious pizza pie on my final day in Chicago, but wish I could have found it earlier, as I would have eaten it each and every day!! The ambiance reminds me of a Soprano's episode. It's a bit of a wait and extremely filling, so make sure that you come to this spot hungry. Between three HUNGRY girls, we ordered a medium deep dish pizza, and were unable to finish the entire thing",5
"A very good French style restaurant.  The view of the city is nice, especially on a clear day.  Although, I still feel that the John Hancock has the best view.  Food is delicious.  It's a set course meal.  You can choose from either 3 course, 4 course, or tasting menu.  It started out at $89 for the 3 course meal, and I can't seem to remember the prices for the rest.  There were 4 of us holding an early birthday celebration for my sister, and we had the following: Starters: - Roasted Maine Lobster in Alsace Gewurztraminer Butter and Ginger - Casco Bay Sea Scallops, Alsace Cabbage Salad, Caraway Seed and Melfor -  Vintage Carnaroli Risotto, Wild Forest Mushrooms Entrees: - Classic Baked Filet of Sea Bass Backaoffa Alsace Style - Magret of Mulard Duck, Wild Pine Honey, Marinated Turnips à la",5

"This isn't everybody's thing. A lot of people who have never had stuffed pizza before and try it for the first time are disappointed. I think that people need to stop thinking of this as pizza -- it's something entirely different, but soooo good. I've been eating Giordano's since I moved to Chicago as a kid. Now I'm away at college and can't find good stuffed pizza anywhere, let alone people who actually know what stuffed pizza is :(In any case, Giordano's is the best stuffed pizza in the city. Hands down.",4
"I live upstairs so I frequent Epic Burger quite a bit whenver I'm feeling a fast food dinner or lunch. The burgers are delicious, very well prepared and definitely makes me feel good that they are organic. The fries are amazing and cheap! The chocolate shake (frozen yogurt & skim milk) is AMAZING and super chocolatey. Great place. Plus they hav a good deal on foursquare with every 2nd check in you get free fries (definitely most of the reason why i go here as much as i do haha) They also recently redecorated the inside and it looks very cool. not that it didn't before, but now it's even nicer.",5
"I love Epic burger. Natural product, eco-friendly containers - it's like fast food done right. I have lunch here all the time. Deeelicious.",5
"The BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had, without a doubt. I know Giordano's gets labled as a tourist-y restraunt, but I am a Chicago native and no deep dish pizza will ever beat Giordano's for me (except maybe my mom's homemade deep dish). Nothing compares to walking blocks on a cold winter night and swooping in the revolving door with a blast of warm air and the delicious aroma of pizza. If you hate long waits, call in and order ahead of time or preorder and head to the bar. It takes nearly a half-hour to make your pizza if you're ordering a deep dish, never mind the long wait for a table. But it will all be worth it the minute you take that first cheesy bite. Every time I have visitors to the city, I always take them to Giordano's to have their lives changed, and they always leave happy.",5
"Consistently good Jewish Deli. The matzah ball soup is the best I've had. When we go I always order the Springer on Challah (they won't tell us who makes their fabulous Challah bread!) and it is always terrific. This is a great place for hangover food or if you're looking for an ambient piece of old Chicago. Terrific pickle and green tomato plate as well.",5
"I'm still in love. I was charged 2 different amounts on my credit card the other day, I called the place up, spoke to the owner and he told me to ask for him next time I come in. Well, I did today and he bought me lunch. Now I was only over charged a buck or so and yet he went above and beyond, even apologizing both on the phone and in person, I kinda dig that kind of integrity.",5

Work in the city or looking for a great place to have a good dinner and get to the Bulls or Blackhawks game on time?  This is a place worthy of your strong consideration. Excellent bar/cocktails and an unbelievable staff that have worked there for many years.  I have had some of these people wait on me for over 15 years and I know a few have been there many more than that. My favorite dishes are their Pizza of course (rated as a best by Chicago Tribune---order ahead if you can), their ribs, fish and chips, entree salads, or burgers. Good.  Good. Good.",5

"Still the best darn pizza in Chicago. I visit every time I am in town. The deep dish is the way to go and make sure you pre-order by phone it will save you a 40 minute wait. Giordano's has done an excellent job of keeping the taste, service and quality as they have grown I first visited in the 80's and did the Rush street location almost weekly in college. They still have the goods!!!",5
"Best pizza in Chicago!!!  Anywhere else in this town pales in comparision, seriously.  It's a chain and thank GOD cuz otherwise I'd be limited as to where I could get my carbo-loaded fill of this cheesy goodness.  Oh yes, and their meals/appetizers/salads are worth trying out as well with your side of pizza ;-) GIORDANOS FOLIFE!!!",5

"It felt weird going into a deserted coffee shop then walking downstairs to find a great deli. I had a very delightful fat free tuna salad wrap (called the Catalina). It was made to order with just the right amount of shredded cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. There was a lot of tuna, which is great because now I have lunch for tomorrow. I was also given a generous side of tortilla chips and salsa AND guacamole. Most places charge you for such a thing. My lunch tab was only $6.90- pretty low for Chicago. MMM MMM delish. I will be back.",5
"Had a deep dish pizza with veggies.  Very good.  Love the tomato sauce and the generous amount of veggies.  The waitress very good and we were able to watch Sunday football during our lunch.  Make sure you have lots of time for your meal, a deep dish pizza takes an average of 35-40 minutes to be cooked.",5

"The only thing you should get if you go to Giordanos is the stuffed pizza. You can find better thin crust, but the stuffed is amazing. They put a layer of sauce on top of the pizza which makes it pretty tasty. This location is nice because its near michigan ave but its not too crowded. Great place for people who work near Millenium Park.",4

I always find myself drooling when I'm in line waiting from the amazing aroma of the popcorn wafting in the air. It's kinda pricey, but so good you will forget about the price, lol. I love getting the chi town mix, which is the caramel popcorn mixed with the cheddar pop corn. The combination of salty and sweet is perfect. I always find myself getting a huge bag because it disappears so fast!! If you're ever in Chicago, make sure you stop by this place!",5

"By far one of the best pizza's in town!!  Seriously, this place is a hidden treasure.  The location seems a bit seedy late night, but Exchequer's is always packed with lots of people. From the appetizers to the specialty drinks and all of the pizza in between -- this place kicks a**!!",5
"Believe the hype.  This place is UH-MAZING!  We were soooo lucky to waltz right in and get a table at 6:30 on a Tuesday.  The pizza was SOOOOO GOOOD!  We had the cheese and the supreme.  Both were delicious.   The only tip I've got is Don't Come Here Starving.  The pizza takes up to 40 minutes, so factor that in.  You can order a salad or something light, or eat an hour or so before.  However, this pizza is worth the wait!!",5
"So I'm trying to figure out if I can make it from my office in the loop to 11 City Diner, eat and be back in an hour.  After welcoming a parade of omelettes-- corned beef and pastrami, pesto and protein-- , undertaking their mountainous sandwiches, and loving every drop of bubbies matzo ball soup, I fear I have become an addict.  The matzo ball soup is perfect fluffy proportions; the broth is not too salty. The roast beef is top notch, although I'm not a huge fan of the turkey. I live for the patty melt, cooked a perfect medium rare and doused in thousand island and topped with caramelized onions. Food's great but the best part is the staff. They made us feel like regulars the first time we went. Their friendly, quick and funny dispositions seem to radiate from the management, whose family",5

The staff is very nice and know how to have a good time. Highlight of my day: two guys - one customer and one JJ employee (maybe they knew each other? who cares) dancing to the complete Beyonce Single Ladies single. Yes, they were coordinated and knew the whole thing. I had great seats, and everyone passing by was stopping to take videos and pictures As far as the drinks - it was just... normal.",5
"Yes, Yes, Yes.... This location is the place to go.... Went there for a lunch outing with the coworkers and from the appetizers to the pizza, everything taste sooo yummy, fresh and good! Nothing was over cooked and that to me is the most important aspect when dinning in a pizza restaurant! Our service was good to. I was really impressed!",5
"Super cute place. The wait was very short even though there was a lot of people there on a Sunday brunch, so we just sat by the bar. The bloody mary was yummy. The Eleven City French Toast was SUPER delish! The decor of the place is awesome as well, reminds me more of a classy bar than a diner. Awesome place. Plus who doesn't love brunch at any time of the day?",5
"Best deli in the loop.  It is hidden in a basement but somehow everyone knows about it b/c there is always a line up the stairs and out the door!  All of their ingredients are fresh and you get a side of chips/salsa/guac with your sandwiches or wraps. For a deli, their salsa is amazing as is their guac.  I would highly advise people to NOT go between 12 and 12:30 as you will wait in line, get angry, and maybe not enjoy the food as much as you should! (There are tables and chairs available and you can usually get a spot b/c a lot of people take food to go.)",5
"This has been the only place in the city where I've been able to find sweet and sour tofu.   While I wouldn't recommend eating in, this place is great to get in and grab a quick bite to go.  The outside might put some people off -- it's a small shack (that used to be a hot dog joint).  I've been in there a ton of times at all times of the day, and it's always clean and the people who work there are always friendly. The food is freshly made, and they're willing to take requests.  For $7 you can get a heaping portion of an entree, fried rice and either a crab rangoon or egg roll.   One of the best 'fast food' Chinese places around, and certainly a better value than some chain place like Panda Express.",5

"This was my first trip to Chicago and we were recommended to come here. The cheese was gooey-ooey-yummy. I was pretty much stuffed after one slice. It was super thick and the crust was delicious. I absolutely loved it. The staff was nice and organized. Prices were reasonable, and the wait really wasn't so bad, especially because it was Lollapolooza weekend. I have eaten at Pizzeria Uno here in San Diego which sells deep dish pizza and I actually like their crust better, its so buttery flakey...so I'm at least happy we have that place on the west coast as well.",5

"right when I walked in, i knew I liked this place.  it's warm and inviting.  dimly lit, exposed brick walls.  the building use to be a speak easy and has a ton of character. the service was amazing.  our waiter greeted us promptly and took our drink order and asked if we had any food restrictions/allergies.  we don't -but I thought it was really nice that he asked! the food was AMAZING.   highly reccomended!",5
"My husband & I love this place! We recommend the Thai chicken salad and the bangers/mash. Yummy! This place has a huge smoking and afterwork crowd. Beware if you don't like smoking and have a social phobia. (strangely I hate smoking but it didn't really bother me & when I got home I didn't smell too bad) You will have to muscle in to get a drink if you get there after 5pm. I have not been in on a weekend but I heard its nuts (packed). If you are lucky enough to chat with the bar manager Mary, do so, she is the best! Her tales of her backpacking in Ireland are hilarious!",5

The staff is polite and professional. The service is right on. The food is................well, the food is the best part. When I visited Giordano's, I had a purpose.

"I'm an outsider who recently came to Chicago to visit a friend. One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's. Giordano's came out on top (although Lou Malnati's was a very close second). Quite simply, the pizza was delicious. The defining mark of Giordano's is the cheese overload. We're talking massive, overwhelming quantities of mozzarella that will send you into a state of deep bliss. Unless you don't really like cheese, in which case this pizza would be horrible. But if you're a cheese lover like myself, it really doesn't get any better than this. The other toppings and the crust are also very good, but the cheese - oh god, the cheese - is what really brings this home. We came h",5
"Fantastic food, fantastic wine list, cheese served at perfect temp, and stellar service.  We liked it so much we've been there 3 times in 2 weeks!  Also, other Italian restaurants in Chicago take note, this is how you serve olive oil, fresh and not rancid.  I can't count how many Italian restaurants I've been to in the last year that have had off olive oil.",5
"I am such a fan of Eleven City Diner. I have went there with my mom, friends, and my bf. They are prompt and nice. The food is to die for. This building actually used to be a bank which my mom used to work. I was awed in how they made it a diner. Sometimes it is really crowded and other times it is not really crowded. I personally love the milkshakes, patty melt, red velvet cake, and matzo ball soup.. These are some must-haves! There was only one gripe I had. Last time I was there the waitress bombarded me with a nasty attitude. I had to give her five dollars to get her off my back. Other than that, I had overall good experiences with this diner. Run like forest gump and get to this place!",5
"OMG do I love me some Garrett's! Can't pass by a shop without gettin' some! All that cheesy and caramel goodness! Nothing compares. I used to get some popcorn at the very few shops in the LA area .... not even close. Hey, if you're gonna do it, get the stuff that stains your fingers. Otherwise, why bother? The Chicago Mix is the perfect combo of sweet and salty. I like a little more cheese in mine, however. I usually get a bag of each and then make my own 'mixes.'",5

"I've been here about 4 times since I moved into the condo building across the street. Each time I've been, the service has been terrible. Less than cordial waiters, crappy food, and huge prices. I've gone with three other people who all agree. Too expensive for food that really isn't good. Not to mention, the last time I went there with my boyfriend, they charged him $1.75 for what is equal to a cup of milk (if you're using a measuring cup) and the waitress told us refills aren't free. Are you kidding me with this? Not even a full glass of milk cost $1.75 and no refills. If I had a kid and took them there, that would be about the appropriate size for a kid's milk, but not  for an adult. Their food is bland and boring and costs way more than it should.

We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again.

We arrived at this restaurant and saw empty tables, so we thought a table for two would be easy. The manager explained that they did not have enough servers to service all of the tables, so we'd have to wait for a table. He said it would be a long wait.

I called the restaurant and told them what we'd found, and the guy I spoke to said that we can bring it back a",1
"I've like Giordano's for a while now, but I must give this particular location one star because of an incident that occurred just an hour ago. Several of my coworkers and I were working late at my office and we decided to get Giordano's delivered.  I called in and talked to a woman who REALLY hurriedly took my order.  I ordered a large stuffed pizza, gave her my credit card info, and then she very quickly said 'It will be an hour' before hanging up the phone before I could cancel. We figured it was ok, so waited the hour and the delivery guy was right on time.  Unfortunately, he brought a large thin crust pizza (we ordered stuffed).  I called in and the woman paused for a moment (probably realizing that it was almost time for them to go home) and then told me 'no, that's not what you order",1

"I'm updating this because the last few times we've come here, the service was just atrocious.  Last time our waiter ignored us after we asked for the check and instead spent a good 15 minutes at his friends' table chatting them up.  They were two tables away from us.     Classy. The food is still decent, but honestly, you can do better O'Malley's.  Especially when I have to pay $6 a pint for Blue Moon.  Come on already. What happened?  Luckily, we found other places in the area with much nicer service and prices!!",1
"This place is bad. When I visited here the entire restaurant had one waitress covering all the tables @ around 5:30PM.  Granted there were only two tables when I walked in, but by the time I left (at around 7:30PM) there were at least 15 tables with only one waitress covering the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, the service was slow. Pizza itself is un-amazing.  Bland sauce combined with 'fresh' mozarella cheese and uninspiring bread.  If I were to make a pizza from scratch at home, my oven would make a better one.  I was hoping to taste the good 'Chicago-style' pizza, and what I got was something worse than Papa John's.

I think I'll go for a burger.  I got a bun with what seemed like some kind of meat substance that must have been cooked 7 hours previous.  Seriously, the bun overlapped the burger by about an inch on all sides!  Secret sauce?  It tasted like a watered-down ketchup-mayo and cucumber mix?  Wha?  And every other fry was under cooked.  How does that even happen?",1
"Our sandwiches were good, probably 4 out of 5 stars good. I had a number 8 and my boyfriend had a number 9. However, I had some issues with my most recent visit (today). First, apparently the gentleman working messed up the order of the person in front of me (made the wrong sandwich) and didn't much make much of an offer to fix it. As he was cleaning the topping space from her two Mike's way sandwiches, he took the wayward leftover a pile of oil, vinegar and spices covered lettuce and threw it back in the lettuce bin. GROSS! I hope there's no one allergic the said toppings getting lettuce on their sandwiches. As he was making my boyfriend's #9, he starting making the wrong sandwich. Luckily I was paying attention.

Then waited close to 15 mins. to get my bagel as no less than 3 people were standing around and 1 guy cooking. They did not toast the bagel, but instead threw it on the grill with eggs being cooked for someone else.  Seemed gross. After I get the bagel and am walking down the street I notice no cream cheese on the bagel. Go back to this dump and they hand me a tub out of the fridge with cream cheese.

They might as well have just shut down the entire restaurant during this time because there were only a handful of tables available for other diners, and all the students lining up in the middle of the restaurant to get their food buffet style was very chaotic. I waited with my party for at least 20 mins, but no tables were called during this time at all, and I realized we would not get seated until the field trip had left the building.

For the main course I had the New York Strip in a red wine sauce. It came with diced potatoes mixed with onions and garlic on the side. My husband had the Prime Ribeye that came with mashed potatoes.

I was so excited that even the weird chemically cucumbery smell that hit me when I picked up the food didn't diminish my excitement. But it should've. My wonton soup was bland and the wontons were mushy. My fried rice contained what seemed like less than one sliced Oscar Meyer hot dog and the rest was just unflavorfully mushy rice.

I watched the person assemble the whole thing and chuck it in the microwave. I could not believe it. Who in their right mind microwaves lettuce? The wrap came out limp and steamy all the way through. Avocado was soupy and hot, I removed the lettuce because it was slimy and practically liquified, and bbq sauce tasted thin and wimpy.  It was a complete wreck.

Damm this thing is thick and dense, they really pile on the toppings. However, the quality isn't there. The pie was chaaaheeeezzzy but had a generic taste. The sauce tasted like Wal-mart marinara.

Once I ordered an omelet and when it arrived, it was sitting in a pool of butter. It was completely inedible because it was so saturated with butter. And don't get me wrong, I love me some butter. But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.' And then she walked away. So I wrung out my omelet, gnawed on my burnt toast, paid the expensive bill, and vowed to never return. Show owner comment »",2

"This restaurant is like if an ill-contrived fledgling English Pub failed at Epcot took to the entire nation and planted itself in major cities, attracting people who don't know any better looking for true British fare only to find cookie-cutter menus of very few traditional English foods, merely cluttered with salty typical-American entrees such as a chicken sandwich, or a burger. They do have this thing which seems like a popover but they call it a Yorkshire and it has slivers of super-salty meat which taste like they are from a can. Its really gross. Consider yourself warned!",2
"I give 2 stars only because I do like Jamba Juice. Otherwise there would only be 1. However, last time I went to this location I discovered something that was not quite part of a smoothie that came up through the straw and entered into my mouth. I have no idea what it was, seemed almost like a piece of blue dental floss, but not as flimsy. Sick. Granted, I did not go back because I had already started walking and there were a ton of people in there.",2
"I want to like eleven. I really do. But it's overpriced. The food isn't very good. The two times I ordered breakfast, my toast was burnt both times. Once I ordered an omelet and when it arrived, it was sitting in a pool of butter. It was completely inedible because it was so saturated with butter. And don't get me wrong, I love me some butter. But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.' And then she walked away. So I wrung out my omelet, gnawed on my burnt toast, paid the expensive bill, and vowed to never return. Show owner comment »",2
"Another major Chicago Pizza disappointment. There were seven of us and we got two large Stuffed Pizzas. When the pizzas came out it was hard to find any of the toppings we had ordered. They are misers with the toppings here. They don't skimp on cheese.. there's tons of it, but it is extremely bland cheese. We had to sprinkle a shitload of Parmesan on top to give it a nice tangy flavor. They need to use a cheese with more salt or something to bring out the taste in the pizza. It's just very underwhelming, boring pizza.",2
"I have no idea what's so natural about their pizza. Their deep dish pizza is nothing compared to Pizzeria Uno. Alright, they put tonnes of cheese in their pizza. So, that's the only thumbs up. But their pizza is lacking some sauce and the crust is tough and chewy, not crumbly like Uno's.",2

Why do my vegetables look like they were sitting in a pool of their own sweat for hours? And why do my fries look like they someone just insulted their mothers and they can't do a thing about it? Poor sad dejected things. Now the taste is ok. It's not terrible. But what leaves me angry is that it could be so much better. With just a bit more care taken to put the food together you can have a wonderful burger. Especially with the ingredients that they use. For a place with food that isn't really epic, the service can make up for it. ",2
"i love pizza.  so on my trip to chicago, of course i had to swing by giordano's and try their famous deep dish pizza.  the restaurant itself was kind of generic and could definitely use a renovation.  it wasn't dirty, but just seemed dated.   i went with a group of 4 and we got the fried calamari as an appetizer and a medium special (sausage, peppers, onions) deep dish pizza.  ray got an italian sandwich because he is a rebel.   the calamari was served with a cocktail sauce which was interesting because fried calamari usually comes with marinara.  it wasn't anything amazing though, slightly on the rubbery side and the breading didn't stay on well.  also, the dish came warm instead of hot.   the pizza finally came out and it's a lot.  the three of us eating the pizza barely ate half of it, ",2

"I'm told that this is a pretty good after work spot, compared to the elitism of other bars in the Loop, but during a recent trip after work, I really didn't see what was notable about the place. Standards sports fare on TV (which is really boring when there's nothing but ESPN talk shows without the sound), limited beer selection (the 'non-mainstream' beers on tap are Guinness, Bass, and Blue Moon, to name a few), and notably high prices (the difference between a $4 and $5 beer is that $10 gets you two beers and two tips if the draft costs $4). For the atmosphere and selection, the prices aren't really justifiable.

"While I was across the street finishing up at Aniko, my partner came here for a drink. He always likes my salons based on their proximity to a bar! Anyway, we decided to stay for dinner. I started with the frozen vodka lemonade - awesome! And then we ordered food - I wanted the Audri (turkey melt!). I asked the waiter what side came with this and he had to go check. This sandwich is $10.95 and comes with NO SIDES. My partner's $12.25 Reuben came with sides. Grrr, at that point I felt like I was being nickel and dimed, especially when the side salad was $6 and is almost 100% iceberg lettuce.

Our food was great, or looked great; however, our food came in warm, not hot. The Moshe Cristo looked delicious and my oatmeal came with brown sugar and raisins, so it's great for dieters. :P The kicker: my friend ordered a plain, non-toasted bagel with cream cheese on the side, and they got that wrong. When they served the rest of us was when the server asked her if she had a second choice for a bagel, because 11-City was out of rye. And then she ended up waiting several minutes to get her non-toasted plain bagel. Like people have been saying, the service is ridiculously slow and our server was not attentive.

"My first time to Chicago and I had to try some deep dish pizza. This place seemed like a good choice based on reviews. I love pizza. I waited the 30 mins like he said. Got a sausage stuffed pizza. It looked good and when I took that first bite.....that's it? There wasn't much flavor to it. I couldn't taste the sausage. The worst part for me was the crust. It was flaky for some reason. I was truly disappointed. They were busy and there are many good reviews so I don't know why I don't feel the same way. Not at all impressed. The next day I tried the Art of the Pizza and that's how I expected it to taste!! I would pass here and try somewhere else. But the service was friendly and prompt.",2
"Gross.  When we first walked in, i felt that we may be in a chain type of place, but being from Philadelphia, i couldn't be sure. We ordered a small special and were fine with waiting the 40 minutes for it to be cooked (this is totally understandable) but like Hitarho said, it wasn't the size of the pizza that made me stop after one slice, it was the taste. totally bland and not even hot. I love my sauce too, and this just didn't do it for me. i felt like I had been robbed of my chicago deep dish experience.",2
"I came here for breakfast with two other people a few months ago.  The food was truly AVERAGE and way over priced.  I realize that this is Chicago, so food is not exactly cheap, but the food here is really not worth the money at all.   Also, the whole time we were there, the only thing we could smell was a strong stench of burnt toast.  At first it was not a big deal, but come on...it was very strong and it lasted our entire meal.  It became a bit nauseating and made me lose my appetite by the time our food came. One of the people I was eating with was the one that suggested the place.  She had never been there before, but she heard about it somewhere and wanted to try it out.  She was disappointed with our experience and ended up apologizing for suggesting it.",2

See ya, spinach pie, grilled asparagus and sesame noodles.....you're just too darn pricey for me now.",2

The eggs had too much pepper on them. Wouldn't you let the customer handle if they want salt/pepper on their eggs? The hash browns were greasy. It took quite a long time for us to get our entrees although the place was not crowded. With Wildberry so close, I can't imagine coming back here anytime soon.

You can go to the finest gourmet restaurant and order an item, and it's brought to the table fresh and hot a lot sooner. Think about it. A leg of lamb, a prime rib, an apple cobbler.

"I had a very disappointing experience at this Giordano's. I got there about 10 minutes before it closes and asked if they were still open. They told me they were, but a few minutes later, after I ordered a deep dish pizza, the waitress told me they had 'turned the oven off' and therefore they couldn't make me a pizza (who knows f that is true? About 10 minutes after that they served a pizza to another table, so maybe they just didn't want to wait for the pizza to bake). The waitress was also not very attentive and took about 15 minutes to bring the drinks we ordered...

Very cheesy, nice enough sauce. Didn't love the crust though - a bit too pastry-like. I have had better stuffed pizza other times I have been to Chicago, but this was very good and I definable enjoyed it, so would be a fine introduction to the genre if you are close by.

If you're looking for excellent comfort food.. This is the spot. I like the eleventh street french toast for breakfast; anything with toasted coconut I'm a sucker for.

"5 stars for the food and atmosphere and about 2 stars for the location. I really think the owner messed up by opening in this area because he's missing out on lots of us who would be eating here every weekend, but don't have a car to get to Eleven City Diner. My friends and I cabbed to try it out, but it's way too far to do this all the time. I thought the food was really good...I was very exited to have some good jewish deli food! The owner came over to say hi and he was nice in an obnoxious way.",3
"Walking into ECD is like walking into a more upscale Fat Moe's in the movie 'Once Upon a Time in America.'  The interior is very well done if only a tad over the top with the Hebrew motif.  It's a loft space with high ceilings, great concrete pillars, huge angled mirrors rising up above the bar and all kinds of kitsch from framed paintings of rabbis, menorahs and old framed up LP covers.   The soundtrack here consists of jazz such as Billie Holiday, Louie Armstrong and tunes like 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' -  stuff you might have heard in Fat Moe's in the movie if not for the Morricone soundtrack. Before we walked in I figured we'd run into a bunch of college kids hanging around studying given the area.  That wasn't the case.  And I found out why when I opened up the menu.   Nine bucks for ",3
"Way overpriced for the quality of food.  Let's go item by item... Drink specials- not special, still expensive. Burgers - $10, they are decent, but not worth $10.  They are $7 on Monday, so worth it on Monday only.   Mac n' cheese - $12, I assume because it had truffles in it.  But it was disgustingly filled with white truffle and tasteless cheese.  So the mac n' cheese just tasted like noodles with white truffle....kinda nasty and I like truffles. Potato skins, pretty good, but overpriced like everything else on their menu. Service, not so great either.  We had Robert who seemed pissed off at us from the start.  Not sure why, maybe cuz one of our friends asked if he could just start with a water, but that was before he ordered an app and the $12 mac n cheese!  He also was slow as hell, he",3
"We were in Chicago for a wedding and opted to do Chicago-y things while we were there, hitting up Michigan Ave and Navy Pier.  We stopped in Giordano's for lunch because it's a classic Chicago meal.  It was just ok.  We waited for about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad, and we had to wait about 35 minutes for the pizza, but understandably that's because they have to bake it. The toppings were skimped on, but it was good.  It just wasn't great and something I have to rave about.  I mean, I like cheese and all.  Being from Milwaukee, we get a bad rap about putting cheese on everything.  For the record, we did NOT come up with pizza stuffed with an extra two pounds of cheese. After about 30 minutes to an hour, the extra couple pounds of cheese you consumed will catch up with you in som",3

"Meh.  That is how I feel about this place.  It certainly wasn't 'bad' by any means, but not nearly as good as I was expecting, both from what you hear about it, the atmosphere and the prices.  Tried many dishes and nothing blew me away, which made me sad (I was pretty excited to try this place).  In fact, I would go as far as to say that my entree was just not good.  I'll take the blame on this one, as I shouldn't have ordered a pasta with cream sauce at a place like this... such a run of the mill dish, I'm not surprised that it came out just so so.  Also, a lot of the people I was with really enjoyed the eggplant starter, but I felt it was nothing special. However, I did really enjoy a lot of the appetizers, including the pizza with sausage and mozzarella (very good) and the mussels, as w",3
"Extensive menu full of expensive Jewish food served in an environment that seems to pose the question what if T.G.I. Friday's wasn't owned by a shlameel but still had all the decorations up?

"When I was planning my trip to Chicago, I had a friend recommend Giordano's to me, and after he sent me pictures of the thick slices of cheese and meat I knew I had to try it. 'Apparently they do national delivery!' I said. 'Yeah, but I'm not gonna pay $30 to have it delivered to me,' he replied. 'I love that you know exactly how much the delivery would cost.' Let me clarify that I wasn't disappointed by Giordano's pizza. There are other reviews that echo the bad service and I have to say that it's true. Firstly, it's extremely confusing that the official website lists this location under 130 E Randolph St but it's actually on 135 E Lake St. We placed a carry out order online for a sausage and mushroom pizza which went through fine, but when we went to the front desk (dine in) to ask for o",3

But my friends sure had a problem with her that's why her ass didn't get a tip (hehe) I don't tip rude people ever. But on to the pizza we got half pepperoni, half beef  all I have to say about that was what happenened to it? All we got was globs of cheese and the pizza was lukewarm.

Milkshake.  It brings all the boys to the yard! Fries.  Perfectly crisp and not too greasy! CHEESE CURDS!  The batter is light and crisp, and the cheese is ooey, gooey sharp white cheddar!  BOOYAH! Meh: Gluten free, vegan banana walnut choc chip bread.  Pricey for $6.50! Burger.  Not great, but not bad.  Hits the spot if you're hungry. BLEH!: Green eggs and ham.  This dish was super acidic and not satisfying at all.  My suggestions: more fatty meat is needed to cut through the acid, remove the onions, and serve with biscuit/toast to soak up the juices and grits. Convenient location for those",3
"I want this place to be so good I think my expectations are too high.  Its like a high end Manny's with alcohol and a soda jerk. The diner theme is great and the space is airy and classic (a treat for your parents if they grew up in Chicago).  But many items on the menu are just  a bit off.  I grew up on latkes with a Lithuanian grand mother and mother, and their homemade potato pancakes were amazing!  What they serve as latkes here are not what I remember, nor do my parents.   The sandwiches can be a bit much as well if you don't usually ingest 3,000 calories in a sitting.  The open faced reuben has so much cheese on it you can't even see the meat.  This might be heaven for some, but its just not my style. This is not to say that I don't return here.  There is enough on the menu to satisf",3

Where the 'upscale fast-food burger' concept is concerned (if that's not a contradiction in terms), Five Guys has this place beat hands down, especially from a cost-to-yumminess perspective.",3
"Deep dish pizza is on my top favorite foods to eat, and Giordano's is famous for having great deep dish pizza.  I have eaten here a few times, because their individual lunch deep dish pizzas are quick, inexpensive and they fulfill my need for a pizza fix. Why do i give them 3 stars only?  For starters, the service is terrible.  Each time I've gone to this location, our waitress was rude and slow.  The ingredients are mediocre quality and the price for a regular pizza is not worth the cost. 1 large pizza will run you about $30+.  For that much money for pizza, I want great quality ingredients.   There are other great deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago.  I'm open to suggestions on which to try next.",3

Other falafel sandwiches have tried and come up short- falafels too gritty, wrong/goopy combination of toppings, too far away from the office, etc.   I've passed by this place many times on my quest (it's easy to miss- downstairs with the Roma Pizza and Dunkin Donuts), although today was the first time that our paths crossed.  I asked the Oracle if this falafel sandwich might be the one (read: I ate it).  The answer: this is not the one.  However, with the right amount of training (use a thicker pita that does not fall a",3

A bunch of guys from the office came to a lunch meeting with what appeared to be delicious Mediterranean food, and claimed to have gotten from THE VERY BUILDING our office is in. Score - maybe no more walking to Haifa? Well, it's not as Mediterranean (at least at lunch) as I thought. Their specialty seems to be turkey, which was good, as far as turkey goes. Several gents in the office are hooked on it - multiple visits a week. They have a good collection of sides too, mashed potatoes, corn, etc. Even cranberry sauce. So, I had the turkey platter - which was good, not out of the ordinary. It was a ton of food for not much money though - there's definite value h",3
"Top three reasons I make the trek to the South Loop for the Diner: 1. The mac and cheese with chunks of ham.  The smooth creaminess of the cheese with the little bit of salt from the ham is a fabulous combination. 2.

"This is not a dig to this particular store, but a beef that I have with Jimmy Johns in general.  Where are the freaking pickles? I'm astounded by this. It keeps me up at night. I'm convinced that Jimmy John's is just a front for a spy organization that will be the demise of us all, because we all know it's un-American to serve a sub without pickles. And a big fat pickle on the side is NOT the same.  What am I supposed to do- lob an entire half pickle on my sandwich?  If you ask me, it's adding insult to injury.  Because you know they have pickles there but they won't slice them right.   Otherwise their sandwiches are dece, but I'm too busy flying into a fit of rage every time I get one because they don't have pickles!!!   I think I should go lie down now.   xoxo",3

"I recently tried the turkey burger topped with aged cheddar minus the onions and Epic sauce on a whole wheat bun. Upon opening the box, the turkey patty had the appearance of a smashed 'Wendy's' patty. Yes, it was square but very flat. Regardless of its appearance and removed toppings ... it was tasty. The fries on the other hand, were not good at all (bad night?)  If your liking includes burnt 1/4 length fries with too much sea salt...then go for it! I'm more of a DIY turkey burger girl.  All of my ingredients top out to less than $9.89 (which was the total for my order from here).   With that said, it was a decent change (with the exception of the fries) from the norm and worth another visit (but not anytime soon).",3
"So I work nearby so we go here a lot for lunch and it's OK.  They have really large wraps and the Lisa's Wrap is pretty good.  I don't like their salads though- they just don't taste right to me but the sandwiches are decent.  They have tons of choices too and it's kind of hard to narrow it down to one- and I'm still searching for something that I love there.",3

"I read today that Giordano's is filing for bankruptcy, and sadly I can't say I'm that upset.  It's good, and I could see where some people would like it, but not something I really enjoyed.   I had a slice of the spinach, a tastes of the tropical (their version of hawaiian) and veggie-sausage combo.  All of them had way, way too much cheese for me, especially the first few bites, I might as well have been biting into a big block of cheese with bits of bread and veg stuck in.  I personally would have liked it a lot more if they cut the cheese by about half, and made the bread thicker, since most of the other ingredients were quite tasty.  The crust (where I could actually taste it) was also pretty decent... it's thick and bready but has a good crunchy crust to it at the same time.

The food was decent (considering it's location), my expectation for Asian food in downtown isn't very high. I ordered the bulgoki, and my friend ordered the pho.

"Have you ever been hungry but when you were trying to decide what kind of food to eat, nothing really sounded like it would hit the spot? This place is kind of like that...

Don't get me wrong--the portions are good, and it's all pretty standard breakfast and diner fare that tastes just about what you'd expect. The atmosphere is nice--it's clean and kind of old-timey, and the service is just fine. It's a fine place to grab a sandwich or some pancakes and eggs. It won't blow you away, but it's ok.

"As much as I love french fries, there's always a part of me that thinks 'do I really want to be doing this?' as I chomp into handfuls of trans-fat soaked potatoes.  This place (trans-fat free) helps me transcend that experience and reach a higher and more focused state of french fry bliss otherwise only achievable at Spacetime Flotation Tanks (provided you can sneak in a packet of fries, get in the tank while they're still warm, and keep the fries from getting wet). Given that this place carves out a unique niche in the fast food scene, with its turkey burger and cage-free egg topping (declined), I'm not sure why I'm not more excited about the place.  Maybe it's in part that for all its assembly-line efficiency, it doesn't (yet?) attract the eclectic and often rascally mix of coupon-clippi",3

There was a little bit of a wait, about 20 minutes or so, but I was ok with that. We were able to put in our pizza order before we got a table which was good. Now for the pie, it was truly a pie. The crust was thick and firm, the sauce was on top and the cheese was sandwiched in the middle. It was gooey and a bit too cheesy and salty for my taste, but my hubby loved it. He made me go there two nights in a row. When in Chicago, I guess. The salad I got, a Caesar, was just ok. Go for the experience.",3

Fare wise, I have only had their sliders, which are okay.  They seem to have a tinge of sweetness that may be from the bun which is a bit interesting.  The thin cut fries we got at the latest visit were like those shoestring potatoes you get in the tin at the store - dry and crunchy.  No, tanks for nuh-tin.   I have to give Grace's kudos for having Two Brothers Domaine Dupage on tap.  I highly recommend you try a pint of this brew.  You'll be buying six packs of it at the store af",3

The pizza was good... the cheese was amazing, but the sauce was just not to my liking, maybe it was just me though and my taste buds because my boyfriend and son really liked it...",3
"I came to Goodwin's for lunch yesterday and I absolutely loved it.  I have heard awesome things about this place and I have been dying to check it out.  I hear it gets pretty crowded around lunch time so we came a little later than the usual noon rush and got there around 1.  We snagged a table and looked over the extensive menu.  We all got wraps because we wanted the chips/guac/salsa on the side!  All the wraps sounded delicious - pretty similar combinations but all different.  I went with the Santa Rosa wrap with chicken, guac, sour cream, black bean mix and cheese.  It was amazing - big portion and just tasty to the very last bite.  My friend enjoyed their wraps as well.  I honestly can't wait to go back... I can't wait to try other wraps on the menu!  Well done.",4
"Again... a long Friday lunch.  These summer lunches are really helping me expand my foodie horizons, let me tell you.  One of the other two people had been here before and suggested we go take a long walk down Van Buren to State.  It was a nice day and I worked up a good appetite by the time I got there. The menu is pretty simple, they don't overwhelm you with tons of choices and crazy combinations.  I stayed pretty traditional and got the epic burger on wheat, no onions with aged cheddar.  I'm not a big condiments person so I, unlike my husband, don't douse everything in ketchup and ranch dressing.  The epic sauce was good when I could taste it but a little bit of a kick would have been awesome.   As someone else said below, the patty IS flatty, with a name like Epic I would have expected",4

"45 minutes for a pan pizza...Yup...It was worth the wait. Ordered a small and was had a hard time finishing it off..",4
"Things I love about Gioco: -Their olive oil. I kid you not - boyfriend and I enjoy the bread/olive oil entirely too much for that to be complementary. -Kung-Fu Girl Riesling. no, not just because of the name - or the fact that it's riesling. it's fruity without being too sweet. -Their pasta dishes. Tortelloni is always a great choice - that sage sauce makes me want to lick the dish after I finish. Their gnocchi and pappardelle are also pretty amazing. -Their specials - which is why i can't speak to their regular menu too well. specials...are always amazing though. -Brunch scones! Citrus almond with mascarpone cream, anyone? Beef carpaccio is decent, but nothing to write home about. Ditto with the eggs benedict. Last, street parking can be a pain in the ass - i recommend leaving 20 minutes ",4
"I am a HUGE pizza lover. If I could I would make all my favorite dishes into a type of pizza. My friends and I stumbled upon Giordano's when we took a road trip to Chicago. We heard about Chicago pizza, but didn't know what to expect let alone from this restaurant. We ordered the deep dish and it was really tasty. I did think it had a little too much tomato sauce, but I still finished a slice and helped myself to another.  How could a pizza lover resist another slice?!  We also ordered their mozzarella sticks and calamari for appetizer. Those were good as well. Perhaps I was just hungry, but their mozzarella sticks were extra good and extra cheesy. Our server was also very sweet, which made our experience awesome. I came here with not many expectations and I was not disappointed. I must ad",4
"My friend and I ordered a medium special stuffed pizza and that sucker fed us for 2 meals! We got it to go, so we didn't have to deal with the service that people here complained about. However, even though we ordered it to go, we still had to wait 50 minutes for our pizza to be done! Onto the pizza! As a Californian, a real stuffed pizza was a new experience. There's just so much with a thick layer of cheese and a layer of sauce that's just enough and not overpowering. It's a solid pizza.",4
"WOW... Hidden, but such a treat!  Really liked the food here.   Friendly people around you, good decor... .and yummy sandwiches.  Go for the BBQ chicken sandwich or the salads... (all I've had there).  Very very good.   Considering we went there during lunch, it was a long wait to get seated, but worth it. The staff is prompt, and the place is very clean.   Highly recommend this place for weekday lunch",4
"I had a recent 18 hour quick in quick out visit to Chicago.  Upon arriving at 8pm I had plans to order in from Gino's East.  However, everyone from the airport, cab ride, and hotel front desk all insisted I try Giordano's instead.  As I am from NY... I find I am rather picky about the pizza I eat and rather snobby about it as well.  My plan in ordering this pizza, as I must admit, was to say for once and for all that Chicago Deep Dish had nothing on NY, brick oven, thin crust.  Well, my plan was ruined.  The pizza was great.  Now I am not going to compare and apple to an orange and say that which is better... NY or Chicago because the truth is they are completely different.  But... this pizza did not disappoint.  I ordered the deep dish cheese with mushrooms.  The sauce was amazing.  You c",4
"Stopped in for a quick dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  The steak and blue cheese salad was very good, and they served a solid burger as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order the french onion soup again - but it was fine (definitely not as good as the rest of the food)  Service was efficient, and they have a very nice outside patio if al fresco is your thing. I can't wait to stop in again to try the steamed pretzels and a few pints as they have an amazing selection of beers (okay, I also want to bailey's Irish cream cheesecake as well :)",4
"It was late on a chilly Monday night and I had no expectations. I had heard good things about this place and they advertise their four-star pizza, but I was too tired to care. My cousin and I ended up splitting an old hickory turkey burger while we waited for our small deluxe pan pizza (ha). The turkey burger was one of the best I've had and it took a bit of willpower to stop myself from stealing my cousin's half. I swiped the bacon pieces that fell onto her plate instead. As for the pizza . . . the small is huge and it came out hot, cheesy, and bubbly. After one bite, I was sold. While I can't really say that it's 'better' than the other deep dishes in the city, it's really darn good. Great crust flavor and consistency, great sauce, super great cheese (the quality is very good and there's",4
"Great Pizza!  My first stop whenever I come to Chicago, which is several times a year, is straight to have some deep dish Chicago pizza.  Like all places, when ordering a deep dish, order immediately when seated.  The place is usually busy so ask for a menu while waiting.  When eating in the bar, like I did as I was flying solo, gives you more time to enjoy a couple drinks.  Wish they did the mini (personal) size at dinner.  I can do some damage on a pizza but still have some left on a small if trying to eat it all myself.  I'm from the southern California area and we ordered 3 pizzas with overnight shipping a few weeks later for my wife's birthday.  She's also a huge Chicago deep dish pizza fan.  Shipping makes it a little pricey but still tastes great.",4
"GREAT pizza. Such a massive pie it's incredible. Having just moved to Chicago from PA I didn't know many places but I had pizza from Giordano's my last time here. I sort of forget sizing and decided my hungry self could handle a medium. FALSE. I had two slices and I was struggling. To my East Coast friends, please know pie is literal. It is a huge pie of delicious flaky dough, sweet tomato sauce, delightfully stringy cheese, and for my hearty susage. It all combines for a great stuffed pizza. I'm new here and I know some people might say there are better places, but I'm ok with here. (for now)",4
"mmm....deep dish. i love this place, especially their tropic delight pizza. it is soooooo good. its not too much meat and just the right amount of cheese and pineapples for a good balance of salty-sweet. it definitely hits the spot when you're in the mood for it.",4
"I really liked this spot. The red checkered tablecloths and the large dining room full of happy munching people gave a good vibe from the start. We were there at lunch time during the week and we got seated in less than 10 minutes. They served local beers on tap and had a huge menu of Italian pastas, pizzas and fried apps. We went for the zucchini sticks and a veggie stuffed pizza, and we were not disappointed. The pizza was delicious, not too soggy in the middle(as deep dish pizzas are prone to be), not too well done on the edge, just perfect. I got a great taste of Chicago at Giordano's.",4
"In Chicago for business, this pub was located a block down from the hotel and we were thristy for some beers...the name sounded cool, so we stopped in.  I love the selection of British taps...Fullers is well represented, as well as Smithwicks, Guinness and Strongbow (mix the two for a Black Velvet...they pour a mean one here).  Additionally they serve a few domestics like the local 312 from Goose Island Brewery, and Bell's Oberon (yum). The pub fries were great with a side of mayo, not overly greasy and cooked to perfection.  We also had a large plate of nachos that complemented our beers nicely. The service was excellent, and the bartenders play their own mixes over the speakers...Belle and Sebastian was playing loudly, which was a nice change from the usual bar music. There are a few loc",4
"i love the burgers here as well as the made to order milkshakes. the atmosphere is nice and if you dine in they bring your order to your table. however a combo will cost you about $10",4
"Great pizza!  We ordered a medium stuffed with everything in it which was more than enough for three hungry people.  The multiple layers of cheese, toppings, and sauce covered crust easily topped my list for best pizza I had while visiting Chicago.   The Greek salad was meh and the service was a bit slow to get my beer refilled.  But the pizza is the real reason to come here, everything else is just filler. Damn, now I'm craving this pizza.  I think I'll order one to be shipped to CA",4
"Great place for lunch and happy hour! This place made me fall in love with buffalo chicken again.  I got their buffalo chicken wrap which was large enough for me to save the other half for later.  The burgers are good as well. Service is fast.   Great atmosphere to hang out and have drinks after work.",4
"My first Chicago deep dish pizza was Giordano's but I had it in Orlando FL.  I didn't like it.  It was too cheesy.   Now I live next to Giordano and the plan is to order take out there every month.   Spinach and mushroom is yummy but my fiance will not let me order it so we will be having sausage and onion. So what has changed since Orlando?  I don't know but Giordano in Chicago is good.",5
"Great Italian steak joint. The place is narrow but dinning rooms go far back so it looks tight when you walk in but there's room. Atmosphere for dinner is cozy and dark. I would recommend asking for a table away from exposed kitchen because it tends to get noisy and a bit warm from the grill but if you re like me and enjoy watching how it all works then its no problem. They have the best Pappardelle al Ragu Di Cinghiale, which is wide ribbon pasta with a wild boar sauce and pine nuts. Don't let the word boar scare you, this dish is great. The pasta is fresh and handmade and the sauce is not overbearing but it maybe a bit salty if you don't care for salt. Last time I went with some people that never have been there before and they all had great meals and good things to say. Also try the Cro",4
"Plus - they take reservations, the decor is pretty nice, and it serves all different kinds of foods - Parmesan fries, sundaes, salmon burgers, you name it. Minus - it's gosh-darn-loud in there! We got there a little after 7 on a Friday night and it was already pretty full and the music was extremely loud. It's nice if you're sitting next to each other, but if there's a large group of you, you might not be able to hear everyone. If someone would promise me that the music wouldn't be so loud next time I go, I'd definitely come back. Otherwise, I'd pick somewhere else if I want to have a conversation.",4
"We frequent this little joint on our lunch hour occasinally and it's pretty good. Not bad not amazing just good chineese at a decent price. If your going to eat in be warned that it's pretty warm during hotter days. The sesame chicken is pretty tasty as well. Prices are decent and you get a good value for your money.",4
"Oh...my...gosh...this pizza...is like no other. Oooey, and gooey cheesy goodness filled with pepperoni and whatever else you want to put in there. And let me tell you, one slice is PLENTY. But, it is completely good and a must try. Keep in mind though, that you have to wait 45 minutes for the pie to cook, so I suggest ordering a few apps to go with it. Since the pizza is so heavy, we had the Greek Salad which was an enormous plate and enough to feed the 2 of us. Our service at this particular location was okay, nothing to really review about. We came in late, around 10pm so that could have had something to do with it. I'll have to try the thin crust next time I'm in the great city of Chicago.",4
"Yum! Such a mouthful of deep dish pizza can only spell out one thing in the end: F-O-O-D C-O-M-A. Literally, I think I napped after just one slice of these bad boys. Who cares if you don't finish the whole thing? It's still amazing after a day in the fridge, and Giordano's for leftovers is surely better than what I can make for lunch.",4
"Bring your lactose pills! So. Much. Cheese. Cheese on cheese on cheese. On vacation with my girls and we were on the hunt for an authentic, iconic Chicago deep dish pizza. I gathered my recommendations, checked out the local Yelp Reviews, and asked a friend who lives in Chicago what the best deep dish spot is... The most popular Deep Dish pizzas can be found at either at Gino's East or Pizza Uno (according to recommendations)... At the last minute, our friend who lives in Chi-Town demanded that we go to Giordano's because they are the underdog of deep dish and truly have the best pie. We took his advice and headed to giordanos... Now, I can't compare it to the other two places, but i do know that i had one amazing, ooey, gooey, cheesy, sausage deep dish!",4
"Great food! Stuffed crust pizza was awesome. A little too much dough but great taste and quality! Good prices.",4
"So far this is my favorite Chicago style pizza(better Gino's East, and def better than Lou Malnatis) I know i need to try a lot more. Anyways i'd prob only give it a 3.5 but I feel fine with 4 stars. I've never had great service at any Girodano's but average at best with it coming close to bad. The pizza is consistently good no matter how you order it or what toppings you get. The apps are consistently average, think frozen and flash fried.",4
"I think this pizza is okay -- a bit too much cheese for me. But the crust of this pizza is amazing. This particular restaurant has great service. When the waitress made a mistake and had to have our pizza re-done, they offered to give us any appetizers we wanted on the house. Pretty nice :).",5
"I had lunch here with my wife this weekend. The food is usual pub fare, but they did it very well. The buffalo chicken salad my wife had was very spicy, which is good, and I liked the reuben, which had more meat than usual and less sauerkraut. The fries are excellent, cut slightly thinner (though not toothpick) and crisper than most and heavy on the seasoning, which makes for some great fries. The service was quick, the dark wood look of the place was nice, and the music was surprisingly contemporary considering the overall feel of the place.",4
"The deep dish pizza was great! As other people have said it does take about 35-40mins for pizza to arrive, but I found this tone a great time to sit and converse with friends!Will be going back again.",4
"Everyone remembers their first time. No, I'm not referring to your first sexual encounter. I mean, we ALL remember our first sexual encounter - good or bad. Mine was typical, I guess. At the conclusion, she was sobbing uncontrollably, followed by occasional dry-heaves with a frequent, 'I can't believe that something could be so small,' thrown in. Ahhhh, to be 26 again. Anyway, I was in Chicago in Sept. of '06 visiting some relatives of The Woman That I'm Currently Married To. After a full day of exploring the city and at the same time avoiding getting stabbed in the head with a screwdriver (I don't drink), we were pretty hungry. We came upon this establishment when TWTICMT mentioned to me that I would like it. The place was pretty empty (it was in the late-afternoon during the week) so we ",4
"The location is easily missed and in an awkward basement setting, but besides that they have really tasty sandwiches and salads for a good price.  It is always packed at lunch time, but definitely worth the wait.  The food is really fresh and made right in front of you.",4
"Pretty cool place for an after work dinner and beers. I stopped in here yesterday with a colleague after first heading to Berghoff and finding it totally jammed. I thought the service was perfectly fine, not awesome but not unfriendly or slow. I had bangers and mash, pretty much my standard British pub meal and was not disappointed. The bangers were authentic and yummy, mash and beans were as expected. My London Porters Jack & Cokes were fine too, although my last Jack & Coke was kind of a stingy pour. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to stop by here but if you're in the Loop and want a solid, affordable meal and a couple of pints, E&C is worth a try.",4
"Always a classic!  I like it better than Gino's, and it's a lot quicker to get in!",4
"I tried Gioco because of what the folks at Yelp have been saying. Wasn't disappointed! It had a warm buzz and great food. I had the papardelle pasta with roasted boar (thanks Kristin!) which was superb! The meat was soft and fresh. The tiramisu was just average though- its the heavy kind, not the soft fluffy kind. Overall, this place is one to return to. What's stopping me for giving it 5 stars? The not-so-friendly hostess who DID NOT GREET ME at the door. And who fluttered her (false) eyelashes while trying (for a long 2 minutes) to find my reservation.",4
"Came here before leaving Chicago. Since we had tried Lou Malnati's, we wanted to check out Giordano's to compare. The crust at Lou's is delish, but the fillings at Giordano's was better. We got there early so getting a table wasn't an issue. Overall, you can't really go wrong, melted cheese on a thick golden crust. YUM!",4
"Recently went back and Gioco delivered this time! Went for lunch and had a delicious Prosciutto melon salad and the rigatoni entree (huge portion).  Service was great.  Glad I gave it another try.",5
"Went here with the in-laws while they were visiting from out of town. While the food was far from healthy, it was a delightful little place for brunch on a Sunday. I liked the laid-back soda fountain theme, and the service was great. We will definitely go back.",5
"I knew I wanted some good Chicago-style pizza while I was out in the windy city, and I'm glad I found it at Giordano's. It was exactly what I hoped it would be, and I enjoyed every bite of it. Their thin crust was pretty good, too! I wish their pepperoni had been better. It was fine, it just wasn't anything special. This isn't a place to go to for the atmosphere, so don't be disappointed. What is disappointing is how cold this place is! It's Chicago- half of the joy of going anywhere in the winter is that it'll be heated. If not half of the joy, then maybe more like three quarters. I almost put my coat back on! And the service is a little slow- yeah, they tell you the pies take a while, but there was no note on the menu that it would take almost just as long for us to find someone to get u",4
"I like this place. I went here for dinner and brunch- both were great. If I had to choose though, I would def do bruch here again soon. So close to my house, and with peach bellinis- you can't go wrong. I split the eggs beny (which was very italian-fantastic) and the lemon ricotta pancakes with a friend. Both were wonderful.",5
"It is a very controversial topic but I believe Giordano's has the best deep dish. They have an awesome crust and the best tomato sauce. I actually crave the deep dish often. The only down side is that, the rest of the things on the menu isn't very delicious or anything. Nothing spectacular but definitely try the pizza!",4
"Friend recommend me to try this place. Certainly not a disappointment. Unique decor and very satisfying, big portion yet delicious breakfast. Quick and friendly services. I had a very pleasant experience. Strongly recommended.",4
"So Good!! As a member of the tribe myself, I am always excited to check out various Jewish Delis/Diners in the Chicago area.  This one really blew me away. As I awaited my table, I was literally drooling over the dishes I saw around me.  When we finally sat down (about a 25 minute wait for mid-day on a Saturday, not terrible for the area) I decided on the roasted vegetable sandwich, sub cheese fries for the salad, because really, they just sounded right. Sandwich came out on this delish foccacia bread and had pesto sauce spread on it.  My only complaint was the too-think slice of roasted onion on the sandwich - it was just a bit much for my taste.  Much to my suprise, and delight, the cheese fries were cheddar cheese fries!  So tasty, gooey, and heart-cloggingly excellent. My friend went t",4
"Once in awhile, I take my 7star schanookie to lunch, and let me tell you, baby, I spare EVERY expense in these economic times! There's something about these greasy little joints. If you get them, you get them -  a siren call no urban sailor can resist. If you don't, no amount of cajoling will get you thru the door. Thankfully - as unashamed as an adult who has not lost their taste for Tang (me) - that is the adoration I unabashedly hold for these boites. Serendipitously, my companion was a good get to go to Gina's on this incredibly rainy day. Plus, it was across the street from where we were. The food. It's a patient man who will allow me my 15 minute menu perusal, culminating in my usual BLT order (the 6 year old palate who still likes Tang) and still be amused by a rare predictable side",4
"Coming from New Orleans this pizza was Freeking incredible. It takes about 30 minutes to get a pie here and if it's real cold outside you can't sit by the windows without dying from exposure. It's about 5 degrees here today. Waitress was kind and had nice lips too.",5
"We just came here last night for drinks since it opened last Thursday. The place is pretty impressive....a marble decor with a trendy, contemporary layout. Its also a 5 mins. walk from where I live, so its a convenient place to catch-up with friends after-work. Other then the drinks selection, the most impressive feature was their  glow-in-the-dark, back-lit menu...we played with it for a good 10-minutes. Still intriguing how bright, shiny objects still captivate our minds. Really friendly staff too.",4
"Despite my refusal to recognize stuffed pizza as pizza, it still was tasty and made for a nice meal.  Not much else to say... good not-pizza pizza.",4
"I like the food at Eleven City and don't mind paying a little extra, I don't think I've been able to finish a meal yet, because of the huge portions. I loved the Reuben and the french toast is probably the best I've had that wasn't made by my Dad as a kid. As far as the spotty service goes, of the three times I've been there so far, the service was pretty bad 2 out of 3 times with the most recent being the best service so I don't think it'll keep me from coming back.",4
"When you are in Chicago is there a better place to get deep dish pizza? I'm not sure there is. This place is a staple of Chicago pizza and has consistent quality. The one downtown has a wait, but I've never had to wait when in the burbs and always had good service.",4
"i'm not a huge pizza fan. but as a friend pointed out, something has to be said about a place that can change the way i think about the food group. i had deep dish pizza on my last trip to chicago and still just wasn't too excited about the whole thing but after my most recent giordano's stuffed pizza experience i think i've finally been converted. for starters, it made me realize that i definitely, definitely prefer chicago stuffed to ANY new york style pizza i've ever tried (sorry anthony bourdain). i loved the tomato sauce to cheese ratio, and the cheese and crust on that thing was just great. the service here was eh and the beer was kinda flat but overall i had a great time discovering a new found appreciation for this bread/cheese/sauce combo. next time i'm in town i'll definitely be ",4
"Not the best, but better than 99.9999999999% of pizzas you will ever eat.",5
"Everyone has their preference of deep dish pizza.  I personally liked Gino's better but just slightly.  Both are very very good places to get a pie.  Just a heads up, I ordered pineapple and instead of baking it inside, it was put on top.  I was a little disappointed about that.",4
"The ONLY thing I can review here is the char-grilled dog combo meal.  Why?  Because it was so freakin' good that I have to order it every time I'm here.   I'm almost ashamed to admit that I like this place.  I won't lie - I'm a girl who loves a great Chicago-style dog.  One day, while picking my daughter up from the train, she begged me to try Gold Coast dogs.  I begged her back to wait til we got home so we could go someplace respectable like Wiener Circle but no, she was determined. 'Fine.  Ugh,' I sighed as I rolled my eyes.  So I begrudgingly ordered two char-grilled dogs with all the fixins.  And was very, very pleasantly surprised!  The dogs were grilled exactly the way I like them - juicy and slightly charred on the split edges, the toppings were plentiful (onions, tomatoes, pickles",4
"I had a great lunch meal here.  I had the Schwartzy on the waitress's recommendation and was not dissapointed.  My wife and I also split a plate of cheese covered fries. I topped it off with a Brooklyn egg cream which was also great. While the sandwiches were great, I didn't think there was anything awsome about the fries (they were very good).  My wife and I also tried the desert a few nights later and didn't find anything about the chocolate or carrot cakes to write home about. At some point I'd like to come back and try their breakfast foods. The lines seem long for most of the day.  We got there at 2pm on a Saturday and had to wait 30 minutes.  On the other hand, we came back a few days later at 8pm for desert and were seated immediately.

"I love opening day of a new restaurant (or chain). You get a warm welcome at the door; the staff is excited; its picture perfect. Overall, things seem to be running smoothly so far. It's really hard to judge a book by its cover at this stage in the game though. Maybe I need to stop in a month from now at 12:00pm to see some chaos. The food is ok. The burger was good, and done quickly. The fries, however, I can't really say that I'm a fan of. I hate flimsy fries. What I don't understand is why this place shares a space with Halsted Street Deli. That is super weird and I can only imagine that when its busy, its going to be nightmare for people getting their drinks at the soda fountain. But maybe their timeliness with filling orders will keep that from happening. We shall see.",4
"I  thought I would give Epic a try, I work just down the block.  A bunch of my co-workers and I checked it out.  I ordered a Portebello burger for $5.99.  Huge mushroom on a Delicious whole wheat bun, good Epic special sauce, normal burger fix ins and add Wisconsin cheddar for .89.  a bag of hand cut fries is $2 but is huge and can easily be shared.   I loved my burger, very tasty.  Fries were good too. All meats are naturally raised and they seemed to care about the environment (disposable silverware that was corn based and bio degradable ) but the recycling can was no where to be found..hmmm Over all my co-workers and I enjoyed our burgers and they were Epic in proportion.  I will go back and split a burger and fries!",4

"When I visited Chicago in 2005 on a roadtrip, I asked where I could get the quintessential deep dish pizza and someone on the street said Uno's. Sheesh...I can get Uno's anywhere. Someone else said Giordano's and since I was walking distance, that's where I ended up. I've only had a couple deep dishes there, but they're delicious and presented with fanfare. The only trouble is the wait to cook them is about 40 minutes, so go there with that in mind. I since returned with family and while walking by, insisted that we head in. They have trouble with groups even off of peak hours, but that's due to the popularity. We had another great meal. Very filling! Count on 3 slices per adult.",4
"This place makes me feel like a fat cow every time I eat there.   The food itself is nothing too exciting, just the standard mall-esque philly steak sandwich... Pretty good, nothing like you'd get in Philly probably.  I get the chicken philly sometimes to make me feel a little less guilty.  the fresh cut fries are tasty, and normally fried right (not overly greasy).",4
"We stumbled on this place when we were in the area.  It has a cool deli vibe to it, very clean and spacious interior.  I'm a big reuben fan, so I had to go with that to see if the quality of the food matched the qualiy of the decor.  I have to say I was impressed.  Very tasty and very satisfying sandwich, definitely in the top 25% of all reubens I've had.  Will definitely come back here when I'm in the area.",4
"Eleven City Diner still remains one of my favorite diners in the city, and even though I'm no longer living down the street, I'll take advantage when I can. I had a great late Friday morning nosh with my friend a few weeks ago, and was glad to see that the vibe seems to be much friendlier and relaxed..and no yelling. No one wants to hear yelling before coffee and eggs, right? As usual, the food was delicious and the service outstanding.   My dad loved Eleven City Diner, and anytime I had the opportunity to take him I did. In his last year he had a fair amount of difficulty getting around, and when we dined out either I or my husband would stop at the front door to take him in and then park. Brad once noticed us, and, not only did he never make us wait to be seated (If it could be helped), ",5
"I love this place.  I love the ambiance and I love Jewish diners.  Sure, it's a bit trendier and more touristy than say, Manny's, but the prices are comparable, as is the food and the portions (although nobody makes a beef stew like Manny's).  I love that they serve Green River and that they have the options of an old fashioned soda fountain, like different shakes, floats and phosphates. The last time we went, they were making fresh kreplach from scratch, so the Ju Pu Platter (which I ordered), took a bit longer than everyone else's food.  I couldn't have cared less, I was enjoying the company I was with and was in no hurry, and since they said it was taking longer because they were making fresh kreplach, I was happy with that.  But then they even gave me a bowl of homemade chicken noodle ",4
"Yes, hole-in-the-wall diners are romantic in that they remind you of the good ol' days and David Lynch and small town America, blah, blah, blah.  Let's face it though, every greasy spoon diner in Chicago is more or less the same - not tasty and not particularly clean.  Eleven City is not an authentic diner but it has AMAZING decor.  Eleven City diner is slightly pricey compared with it's competitors but it has AMAZING food.  Eleven City diner has awful customer service but AMAZING pie.  I always leave there feeling the meal was worth paying a few extra bucks for and I might even add it to my fictional Chicago must-see list.",4
"Has some really good deep dish pizza.  I feel like I've enjoyed the filling better at other places, and this is going to sound kind of weird...but I was really impressed with the crust.   Normally, when I get deep dish, I can't even eat the crust because a lot of places either can't keep it from getting soggy or try to prevent that from happening but just end up making it way too thick.  However, the crust here was perfect - not so thick it couldn't be cut through yet still crunchy and flaky even after the 15 minutes it took me to finish my piece.  Thumbs up.",4
"Good food and fair price",4
"OMG I love deep dish pizza! When I visited Chicago, it was recommended to us that we try the pizza here. My husband and I ordered a medium 'Special' deep dish pizza which had sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions.  After a LONG 45 minute wait (we were starving and it was 9:30pm), our pizza arrived. It was the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. It was a slice of hot cheesy, greasy goodness!  Definitely a must try if you're in Chicago.",4
"Ever since I started my new job across the street, hardly a day has gone by without one of my coworkers mentioning / raving about / drooling over the deliciousness that is Jaffa.  I'd tried the bagels (yummy, piping hot, and fast!), but i had not yet tried the famous turkey sammich- until today!  Oh boy is it tasty!  It's everything they said it was and more- a French roll piled high with plump hunks of real turkey and my choice of condiments.  This lunch spot gets extra points in my book for not immediately asking if I want 'mayo, mustard, hot peppers' on my sandwich.",5
"I was so excited to eat here! I mean, it was amazing! Loved all the cheese and it was seriously so much food! So come with an empty stomach because I could barely finish 1 slice! It's a very popular place, but I was surprised that the wait was not too long, and it was definitely enjoyable.",4
"Suffered through a pretty lengthy, packed-house wait for brunch here while in town for Lollapalooza.  Was not disappointed at all.  There's a reason the crowds are here.  The vibe/ambiance is a mix of old school Jewish deli and busy diner. Eleven City delivered  the best (and spiciest) bloody mary I've ever had.  Though I'm a recent initiate to the drink, I imagine it doesn't get much better than this.  Great start to a morning, particularly when you're headed to a music festival in a couple hours. For our meal we had the 'mexican scramble' and the signature french toast.  Both were excellent.  One of the best egg dishes I have ever tasted for sure; cheesy, a little spicy, perfectly cooked.  Only had a couple bites of my girlfriend's french toast, but it was delicious as well, and she gave",4
"Known affectionately as 'The Shack' by my former colleagues, I remembered this gem while looking for lunch downtown today.  This tiny place has an extensive menu of fast Chinese food, bubble tea, smoothies, and lychees.  You order at the counter, hear the order repeated in Chinese to the kitchen staff, and have your food within minutes - steaming hot!  This place is geared towards the downtown lunchtime crowd - people who need food fast and are returning to their desks to eat it.   Today I had the sesame chicken lunch special (it came with fried rice and a crab rangoon) and a kiwi lychee.  The chicken was thoroughly yummy and the crab rangoon was freshly fried.  FRESHLY FRIED!!!  It was a little heavy on the cream inside and not so full of crab meat, but it was good nonetheless.  The lyche",4
"I must have walked by this place a million times and never even knew that it was also a restaurant; I always assumed it was just a bar/lounge, but once again, thanks to Yelp, I learned that they serve lunch too. I am always on the lookout for new spots to have lunch in the Loop, besides the dreaded fast-food options that pollute every block, so when the ex-fiance asked me to lunch after he recently got married, this seemed like the place to go. New lunch place for me, new marital status for him. Newness all around. I walked in and two things struck me: we were able to be seated immediately at noon, which if you work downtown, you know is no small feat, and bonus: they were playing great 70s oldies. I mean, when was the last time you heard 'Still the One' by Orleans? Years, right? I thought",4
"Great popcorn.  A bit on the pricey side but once they get you hooked on the carmel/cheese combo you become like a coke addict and will pay anything for your next fix.  One of the dumbest things I have ever done in my life is waiting in line for two hours at Christmas time--save yourself the hassle and just order off the Internet during the holidays.",4
"On a recent visit to Chicago, my friend and I dared to sample Giordano's highly recommended 'thin crust' cheese pizza. I say dared to sample because we ordered an extra large on our first day, thinking we could easily stretch it out to last for our three day visit, but it was hard to resist its temptation every time we opened our fridge at home!! Great, friendly service and mouthwatering pizza. Unforgettable!",4
"Total dive bar and hole in the wall type of joint. I love it. Great jukebox, great parking late night, and you can always get something to go late night. Atmosphere isn't great at all....But that's not the purpose of this place.",4
"This is a really great deli!  They've got really great sandwiches, they use Boar's Head which is awesome!  But they also have sushi and salads and great coffee. Its the perfect place for a snack any time of day!",4
"Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had. I love Chicago deep dish! Each slice of the pie is a meal in it's self. It's well worth the wait and the price.Fresh ingredients, hearty meats and cheeses, delectable sauce, and perfectly crisp, golden brown, flaky, 'melt in your mouth' crust! New York has nothing on Chicago when it comes to pizza, and Giordano's is a perfect example of this!",4
"I don't eat pizza typically, but this place is awesome. give your self an hour to eat here, because it will take 40 min for them to cook your pizza. best pizza ever.",5
"Fantastic food, fantastic wine list, cheese served at perfect temp, and stellar service.  We liked it so much we've been there 3 times in 2 weeks!  Also, other Italian restaurants in Chicago take note, this is how you serve olive oil, fresh and not rancid.  I can't count how many Italian restaurants I've been to in the last year that have had off olive oil.",5
"Welcome to the neighborhood Jimmy Green's.   We are so happy to have you!   I agree with previous review that the South Loop was definitely in need of a place of this type.    Jimmy Green's is a modern sports bar offering a creative menu and personable & genuine staff.    They are not scheduled to open until June 5 but got smart by doing a preview opening during the Stanley Cup games.   My boyfriend went to Jimmy Green's for game 1 and enjoyed his experience so we returned for game 2.     We received a friendly greeting from the two guys checking ID's.  The hostess said there were no tables available and told us to check the bar, which clearly was full so don't know why she would even make such a suggestion.    We were a bit annoyed by her tone and fact that she didn't even offer to take o",5
"This is a new venue that replaced the Old Timer's Restaurant. Einstien has great coffee and a much better selection of breakfast treats than the typical venues on the block. My favorite is a toasted cranberry bagel with jalapeno salsa cream cheese. Sounds weird, but it's so awesome. Five stars for great service and food for the money.",5
"Awesome place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! The bloody mary's have a way of luring me in for more... Brunch is cool and casual- omelets are amazing... waiters and waitresses are friendly... the food is delicious, no matter what you order...",5

"Probably my favorite place to get lox (and latke) in the city.  The place has amazing ambiance but sometimes the wait can be quite long.  It deserves more 5 star ratings! The owner (Brad) is very nice but usually hard to get a hold of.  If you do see him he's a great guy to talk to.  Also try the corned beef hash, the Shappy or the Schwartzy!",5
"Last visit: April 2009. Friday dinner for two. This is my favorite location for my favorite restaurant! Great environment with multiple seating areas and location is fantastic (near Millennium Park). Food and service is always great! If you've never been, get the stuffed pizzas! I always get the large stuffed pepperoni and you'll do the same if it's your first time! However, keep in mind these things are thick and take time to cook (40 minutes to an hour depending on how busy). You can avoid the wait by preordering by calling in advance and letting them know when you will be stopping by to eat, which is what my friends and I always do. The only downside to this location is that it is always relatively busy when going for lunch or dinner on the weekend. Because of this, preordering in advan",5
"After brushing off the remnants of Tropical Storm Danny, our crew landed us in Chicago a couple of hours before midnight.  However, the relatively short night would not place a damper on my planned stuffed crust pizza excursion.  Indeed, a couple of weeks ago, super Yelper Andrew W. was nice enough to provide me with a week old slice of Giordano's pizza.  I greedily accepted the offering knowing full well that I was going to repeat the experience in Chicago.  Why?  Much like sugar in a properly sweetened iced tea, one's stomach can never be too saturated with Chicago's best stuffed crust pizza. SG warned me that the Giordano's in his neighborhood was closed.  I laughed off this feeble attempt to thwart my mission.  A few phone calls later, SG and I were happily driving to the edge of Greek",5
"Simply put they only had one pizza crust left so we all shared the pizza as an appetizer and it was obvious why there was only one left once I took my first bite. YUM! The fish of the day was delicious, the wait staff was friendly, excellent wine selection, and guests here would certainly feel comfortable dressed up or dressed slightly down. Date Rating: 8  (nice dim lighting, easy on the eyes) Pick up Scale: 4 Strong Suggestions: Reservation.",5
"Giordano's deep dish pizza is better than sex. It sucks living in California because we dont have any deep dish pizza places here. I plan on buying a home soon in Chicago so I can go to portillos, giordanos, and whitesox games.",5
"The Best Stuffed Pizza in Chicago. It just is. Gino's, Uno and Due, Lou Malnati's? Please. You guys 'coulda been a contender', but ended up being mere pretenders to the title.   Giordano's wins. Can be slow, of course it takes a long time to bake the deep-dish pizzas, but the service itself is also sometimes slow. Giordano's is a fairly large chain of restaurants with about 40 locations in the greater metropolitan area, and some other places as well.   So it's somewhat formulaic, if you have seen one then basically you have seen them all. However the uniform quality also means that you know in advance that it's going to be really good.",5
"Best Pizza in the world. Better than Lou Malnatis or Gino's East! The deep dish is the best. No one comes to Giordanos and gets a thin crust!!! The sauce is perfect (YES IT IS ON TOP IF THE CHEESE), the cheese gooey, and the double crust is heaven. Perfectly spiced.One slice fills me up of pepperoni and cheese. The service is never bad in my experience and I like the atmosphere, very Italian. They have a lunch special too which I always get , you get a salad or soup, your own indvidual stuffed pizza, and a can of pop for like $7 bucks. The sandwiches and appetizers are also delicious, my mom always gets the chicken.  But....get the pizza you won't be sorry trust me!! Greasey flat New York Pizza does not come close...AT ALL!",5
"Eleven City Diner is a must stop, whenever I visit Chicago.  It is always a good cure for what ever ails you. This half deli, half diner seems family owned because the owner (Brad) is always near by to check in and say hello.  I am amazed at how he always remembers me, even though I am only there a few times a year, at most.  Very passionate about what he is doing and his customers. I even met his mom once. Nice touch ;) You can taste the LUV that goes into the food.  Fresh, HUGE portions that are oh so hot and yummy!!   They offer breakfast all day, fantabulous bloody mary's, and a massive menu of all-american comfort food   The boyfriend, always orders the pastrami.  It is piled high on a number of the menu items and is always enough for two. Their Challah is homemade and fresh.  They us",5
"My favorite lunch spot in the loop.  Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious, and they are very good about modifications to the standard fare (as one who loathes sour cream, this is key).  The food is varied - sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc - so there is something for everyone.   I lean towards the wraps, which come with chips, salsa, and guac.  Personally, the salsa is a little spicy, but they always let me swap it for a guac instead.",5
"Best pizza in chicago!!",5
"If I lived close enough I would be here every day for at least one meal, maybe two.  Eleven City is a fantastic Jewish diner that seems to have been transported from New York City to downtown Chicago.  We have been here at least 10 times and bring everyone who visits us to this restaurant, YES its that GOOD! When you visit, get anything with corned beef, pastrami, or their rye bread; you cant go wrong.  Our last trip we got the deli scramble; scrambled eggs with corned beef and pastrami it was fantastic.  Get yourself a reuben your first time, you will become a maniac about Eleven City like me after one.  Their meats are absolutely tastebud melting. They have real soda fountain on which they whip out wonderful concoctions I think only my grandparents would remember.  Their shakes are thick",5
"My first pho experience happened to be here. Not sure if this is a good place to start for this wonderful dish but it just happened that way. I was walking down Mich Ave with a certain lovely lady, and pho was brought up,  and Yelp brought us here. The food court location (entrance is located on Lake right next to the McDonald's) made me a bit skeptical at first. The portions were pho-nominal and it all tasted great to me. I particularly enjoyed the brown sauce that it came with (similar to teriyaki) for mixing in. Bean sprouts and Asian basil came on the side. I enjoyed my first pho experience here. Now I will be searching out the next best place to get it in the city as winter is upon us. Truly warms the soul.",5
"This is another place that I have to hit up when I'm in the city. The lines can get really long, but it is absolutely worth the wait. I always find myself drooling when I'm in line waiting from the amazing aroma of the popcorn wafting in the air. It's kinda pricey, but so good you will forget about the price, lol. I love getting the chi town mix, which is the caramel popcorn mixed with the cheddar pop corn. The combination of salty and sweet is perfect. I always find myself getting a huge bag because it disappears so fast!! If you're ever in Chicago, make sure you stop by this place!",5
"Berry Fufilling- its true! I had this smoothie for breakfast, and I didn't want to eat lunch. I tried to go with a selection low in calories and lower in sugar than the rest, and this was the winner. I loved it! The only problem was they were out of raspberries, and so they used extra strawberries and blueberries. I didn't mind, but that's just a warning to anyone who is a raspberry fanatic. Hopefully it doesn't happen very often.  My friend was shocked when he found out I had never been to Jamba Juice. Now I can see why. I waited way to long! I may be a Jamba Juice regular now.",5
"Really great deep dish. I think the crust Is lake pancake or biscuit batter.  If they would have given me gravy it would have been an amazing feast. Great job guys.",5
"So I'm trying to figure out if I can make it from my office in the loop to 11 City Diner, eat and be back in an hour.  After welcoming a parade of omelettes-- corned beef and pastrami, pesto and protein-- , undertaking their mountainous sandwiches, and loving every drop of bubbies matzo ball soup, I fear I have become an addict.  The matzo ball soup is perfect fluffy proportions; the broth is not too salty. The roast beef is top notch, although I'm not a huge fan of the turkey. I live for the patty melt, cooked a perfect medium rare and doused in thousand island and topped with caramelized onions. Food's great but the best part is the staff. They made us feel like regulars the first time we went. Their friendly, quick and funny dispositions seem to radiate from the management, whose family",5

"Super cute place. The wait was very short even though there was a lot of people there on a Sunday brunch, so we just sat by the bar. The bloody mary was yummy. The Eleven City French Toast was SUPER delish! The decor of the place is awesome as well, reminds me more of a classy bar than a diner. Awesome place. Plus who doesn't love brunch at any time of the day?",5
"The freshest sandwiches in Chicago hands down. I love the Newport with avocado, tomato, and mayo! Yum If you don't like waiting in line, definitely call ahead with your order. The lines can get out of control.",4
"I love this place! The yummy popcorn is moderately priced and very addictive. Unfortunately you cannot get this popcorn unless you order online or downtown. The Chicago mix is gooey caramel and cheese popcorn and believe you me, you will EAT every drop. Whenever I visit St. Louis I must bring a can to my family there. If you see the long lines, jus make sure you go ahead and have your money ready, and stay off your cell phone, they won't work with you if you are on the phone! It's worth the stay in line. It is sooo good it will melt in your mouth. Like I said, worth every buttery drop.",5
"mmmm . . . .Jamba Juice . . . . pick a location . . . not quite as 'around the corner' as speedway - or Starbucks for that matter . . . Jamba Juice is heaven for breakfast. But watch out - if you don't get a smoothie from the englightened side of things, even though it's all natural you're still looking upwards of 400 calories for a medium. My favorite? Strawberry Nirvana with an immunity boost, and a burner boost to get the metabolism rockin' in the morning . . . can we say GO?",5
"By far one of the best pizza's in town!!  Seriously, this place is a hidden treasure.  The location seems a bit seedy late night, but Exchequer's is always packed with lots of people. From the appetizers to the specialty drinks and all of the pizza in between -- this place kicks a**!!",5

"So it was quite an adventure trying to get into the parking lot but it only added to the allure of the French gem! Thank goodness my mother had been there before and thus wasn't too confused by all the different passageways! The views to the West were phenomenal and we luckily were seated next to the window. Admittedly it was a bit stuffy in here but at these prices and quality of course that is to be expected - they aren't slap-happy @ Trotter's either ... After viewing the menu, I strongly resisted the urge to toss our theater tickets and just go with the full tasting menu!

I was very happy with my purchase and give this Garrett's 5 stars...now I have to cause my fingers are orange from my Chicago mix popcorn......",5
"I know that visitors to Chicago always want to go to Gino's East, but Giordano's has the best pizza in the city!This particular location is great because it's near CTA, South Shore and Metra.  It's also near Millennium Park and has a view of the beautiful courtyard at Prudential Plaza.  On a nice day - or if the restaurant is extremely busy - you can get your meal to go, complete with utensils and plates, and have a picnic in the courtyard or the park.",5

"OMG do I love me some Garrett's! Can't pass by a shop without gettin' some! All that cheesy and caramel goodness! Nothing compares. I used to get some popcorn at the very few shops in the LA area .... not even close. Hey, if you're gonna do it, get the stuff that stains your fingers. Otherwise, why bother? The Chicago Mix is the perfect combo of sweet and salty. I like a little more cheese in mine, however. I usually get a bag of each and then make my own 'mixes.'",5
"Being from California, our definition of Pizza is Pizza Hut, Round Table, etc etc.  After going to Chicago and going to Giordano's, I have a whole new appreciation for Pizza, especially Deep Dish Pizza.  It was by far the best pizza I've ever had.  Expect the place to be PACKED whenever you go, so there is going to be a wait, but it def. is worth the wait.  The aroma of the place is enough to keep you around.  Service was outstanding.  All around good experience...def go if you're in the Chicago area",5
"Still the best darn pizza in Chicago. I visit every time I am in town. The deep dish is the way to go and make sure you pre-order by phone it will save you a 40 minute wait. Giordano's has done an excellent job of keeping the taste, service and quality as they have grown I first visited in the 80's and did the Rush street location almost weekly in college. They still have the goods!!!",5
"On this visit, I was asked if I've ever rated a Giordano's less than 5 stars.  The answer is no. Even though the pizza was light on sausage and mushroom, it was delicious, flaky, doughy, cheesy goodness.  My stomach is growling for my last leftover slice right now, and it is 7:26am.  Don't judge me. I had never been to this location before and anticipated it to be less crowded than the original or any other Chicago location, but I was wrong!  There was a constant line and groups waiting outside on Friday night.  And for good reason! Vote for Giordano's!  You won't be disappointed. P.S.  It's awesome that you can pre-order your pizza as you wait.",5
"Yes, this is the Chicago-style pizza you're looking for! If it's crazy busy, you can totally pre-order your pie while you wait for your table. Try the Hawaiian;)",5
"The BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had, without a doubt. I know Giordano's gets labled as a tourist-y restraunt, but I am a Chicago native and no deep dish pizza will ever beat Giordano's for me (except maybe my mom's homemade deep dish). Nothing compares to walking blocks on a cold winter night and swooping in the revolving door with a blast of warm air and the delicious aroma of pizza. If you hate long waits, call in and order ahead of time or preorder and head to the bar. It takes nearly a half-hour to make your pizza if you're ordering a deep dish, never mind the long wait for a table. But it will all be worth it the minute you take that first cheesy bite. Every time I have visitors to the city, I always take them to Giordano's to have their lives changed, and they always leave happy.",5

"Here's how my luck goes:  a few months back, was walking aimlessly on Wabash with hunger pangs that were going to lead to some serious damage being done at the next reasonable food joint I saw.  So I see India Grill and went on to have a pretty subpar experience. Little did I know, the spot next door, Eleven City Diner, is seriously beastly with their food and no one had passed me the memo. I see what kind of friends I have.... Nonetheless, the food at Eleven City is unbelievable.  I got the Sam Levy Chicken sandwich. It was spicy, like I like everything, juicy and I had a lot of fun dipping it in ketchup. Special shot out to the chollah bread it was served on!  The bartender, Jennifer, was also extremely nice and informative and recommended I have a chat with a Dead Guy (its a beer. Hadn'",5

"We go here at least a few times a month and the staff and food are great. In the style of the 'old school' deli with new flairs, (ie, old school= Katz's in NY, Kanter's in LA, rascal house), this place has a lot of character. I've noticed that a few people misinterpreted this as attitude...it is not... it is personality and comes with great food. The corned beef is a tasty standard, I'm a fan of the corned beef-pastrami hash (however, it doesnt work for those dieting); the lox platter is a favorite. Tried everything from omelets to burgers and all has been close to perfect. (i am quite picky and have high standards with my food as my other reviews show). None the less- hit up the bar, great bloody mary. If you go on a weekend morning expect a slight wait-- can be 5 minutes to half an hour.",5
"Great Burgers, good prices, and a fun crew. The only thing that they could improve on is the time it takes to make the food. Sometimes even during the slow hours it takes like 20 minutes to receive the food. Other than that, the place is fantastic. You gotta love their turkey burger on wheat!",5
"Wow, bombalicious pizza, man! That's how I remember the Giordano's pie. The pizza is super thick, and baked tall like cheesecake. Layers and layers, like lasagna baby! I've tried pizza in: Italy...super thin, crackerlike crust Da Left Coast...hate it Regularly now in New York City...average pizza joint has 'bout 1/2 inch or so crust But the hype I heard iz Giordano's is da bomb for Chicago T-H-I-C-K style pizza...yo, belee da hype Yo, if this joint were to plop a shop in Manhattan or just about anywhere else in New York City, it'd be instant success! Gimme a shout out, if any of y'all know a pizza joint like Giordano's in New York City.",5

"Great little grease factory in the south loop, just  a block and half away from the Harold Washington branch of the Chicago Public Library. Actually a decent value, I've paid more for a burger and fries in the suburbs. Fantastic mozzarella sticks too. The inside is small, maybe 9-10 tables and a 3-4 person bar. In the summer they set up a few outdoor tables. If you come during normal lunch times be prepared to get creative in your eating location.",5

It gets very crowded here, so best come early, or be willing to wait at least an hour before you get seated.  And then another 30-45 min for the pizza to actually cook.  Everything is made fresh to order, and when it gets to your table, it is piping hot.  It's cool that they serve it on a stool-like thing to make it easier for the servers to cut the pizza.  For many people, 1 slice is enough to satiate your hunger for pizza and make you come crawling back for more next time. I'd have to say the best thing about the pizza is that since the cheese is on the bottom, and the toppings mixed in the marina",5
"HANDS DOWN, THE BEST POPCORN EVER. And I don't even like popcorn!  Thanks to Chicago Trolley and Double Decker Co., my family and I each received a free bag of Caramel and Cheese popcorn.  When someone recommended the Caramel and Cheese, I was really skeptical since I don't like caramel.  However, it's the perfect mixture!  Pop in one of each at the same time, and it's a great combination of sweet and salty.  SO GOOD.  Definitely worth the stop if you're ever in the area.",5

I even met his mom once. Nice touch ;) You can taste the LUV that goes into the food.  Fresh, HUGE portions that are oh so hot and yummy!!   They offer breakfast all day, fantabulous bloody mary's, and a massive menu of all-american comfort food   The boyfriend, always orders the pastrami.  It is piled high on a number of the menu items and is always enough for two.

Unfortunately, this place closes a little early for me. I think around 8pm. I flew into Chicago for Business and we couldn't find a Garret's....we just decided to chow down to a good dinner. Fortunately there's a Garrett's inside ORD at the United terminal. I grabbed a couple of bags and the popcorn was good for a couple of days. yummy!!!",5

This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous.

They might as well have just shut down the entire restaurant during this time because there were only a handful of tables available for other diners, and all the students lining up in the middle of the restaurant to get their food buffet style was very chaotic. I waited with my party for at least 20 mins, but no tables were called during this time at all, and I realized we would not get seated until the field trip had left the building.

We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again.

A little over a month ago, we decided to go over to this location and have dinner, but the wait was over an hour, so we switched to take-out and waited for our pizza. It should have taken 40 minutes, but ended up being close to an hour and ten minutes before they informed us they had given our pizza away by accident. Instead of giving us a free pizza for the 2 hour wait for our pizza, they gave us 3 dollars off and sent us on our way. There was little apology for the mix-up. Once aga",1

Sadly, Everest was THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD at a fine dining establishment.

I also decline to wait but I want my money back. They agree to take the pizza and give me a refund provided its not been eaten.

The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary.

"We arrived early for dinner (5:15) and had no trouble getting seated promptly. However, by 06:00 the place had practically filled up and I expect there was a long wait. Part of the reason for this is the waitress informed us the cook time for deep dish (DD) would be 35-45 minutes and since our son had never had DD before, he opted to try a peperoni and cheese DD. However, that pretty much puts anyone getting DD at 60-90 minutes minimum, so that explains the long waits and low table turnovers. It also encourages people to order the appetizers which we resisted to keep the bill down. We opted for a thin crust pizza and promptly scarfed it down as we had been walking all day. He said his DD pizza was good but I don't think he was a fan of all the cheese - DD is definitely an acquired taste. T",2

Giordano's is known for it's stuffed pizza, but the minimum size was 10' versus 6' at Lou Malnati's.  It was too much pizza for one person, and I was underwhelmed by the top and bottom crusts (which is what makes it 'stuffed').  If the crust is good, then one is more than enough.  And Lou Malnati's version also came out ahead in the pizza category for me.",2

I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out.

When they bring it out to you, the place it on the special pizza stands that all of the tables have, and serve you your first slice.

The food, however, didn't impress.  Menu had variety, but it was a pub so fish and chips was the obvious choice for me.  Wish I hadn't.  The portion size was enormous (that's a good thing) but after a bite or two that didn't matter as much.  It's not that it tasted BAD, it's more like it didn't taste like much of anything.  Blah, no flavor, didn't excite me in any way.  Others said similar things, it was decidedly so-so I guess.

"Sorry Giordano's, but I'm not a fan of your pizza.  There's too much cheese and not enough of the other ingredients.  I wasn't sure what to make of it.  The crust is not so bad though.  The combination appetizer with mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini and fried mushrooms were okay.  The breading was good but the ingredients inside somewhat plain.  Skip this place when visiting.  Much better pizza can be had elsewhere.",2
"I don't get it- deep dish pizza. It's really a lasagna but has layers of bread instead of noodles. And the bread isn't anything wonderful or distinctive- like a San Francisco sourdough, say. The regulars here know that there's a 40 min wait for the pizza to be delivered to the table from the time the order is placed. That's a looong time. I think it's an annoying affectation. You can go to the finest gourmet restaurant and order an item, and it's brought to the table fresh and hot a lot sooner. Think about it. A leg of lamb, a prime rib, an apple cobbler. The restaurant doesn't start from scratch when you order. Giordano's is a cult  and they've got diners believing that the pizza tastes better when they make you wait.

"My first time to Chicago and I had to try some deep dish pizza. This place seemed like a good choice based on reviews. I love pizza. I waited the 30 mins like he said. Got a sausage stuffed pizza. It looked good and when I took that first bite.....that's it? There wasn't much flavor to it. I couldn't taste the sausage. The worst part for me was the crust. It was flaky for some reason. I was truly disappointed. They were busy and there are many good reviews so I don't know why I don't feel the same way. Not at all impressed. The next day I tried the Art of the Pizza and that's how I expected it to taste!! I would pass here and try somewhere else. But the service was friendly and prompt.",2

"Been there, done that, don't care for it. I don't mind the idea of the stuffed pizza, cheese, toppings sandwiched between two layers of bread-y crust in pizza form topped with tomato sauce, but the stuffed pizzas here weren't anything inspiring.  The topping combos are uninspiring and not even fresh-tasting with the veggies unlike Gino's East.   I'm not sure what I'd like to see in stuffed pizzas that would draw me to it, but I know from experiencing this iconic establishment I have found nothing to draw me back to it.",2

I can't explain how good it was unless I go back and look at my monthly credit card statements because I probably ordered it once a week for months until it was off the menu. Don't expect too much from this place- the food is standard pub fare w/o that Whitefish sandwhich to choose from, the beer is slightly overpriced (but that's not the end of the world). Bears games, though, are pretty good and I do enjoy the brunch and have been there for ESPN1000 (Mongo and Coppock) broadcasts. And the staff is pretty friendly- have never had a bad time. So the review is mostly for the food.",2

Judging by the long lines I figured it would be totally worth it, but it wasn't at all. The line moved pretty slowly, considering the product and the fact that it is already totally prepared. At one point, a girl came out to refill the cheese popcorn and it was in a giant plastic bag that she cut open...as if it was made in some big factory (was I naive to think it would be made there?...or was it? I dunno). Anyway, I got cheese popcorn and I don't usually complain about things being too expensive, but it was! Oh well, what the market will bear, and all. It was tasty enough, but mixed in with my cheese were random pieces of caramel (no, I did not get the 'Chicago Mix'), along w",2

"Beer can take the edge off of a rough day.  Fortunately, I was also in good company.  My friends know that there's nothing like a good beer and some unhealthy appetizers that will cheer me up.  On that particular day, we decided on Elephant and Castle because everyone was coming straight from work. The selection of British beer is impressive and there are 8+ selections on draft.  The food is standard pub fare.  Unfortunately, the kitchen did not have a few of our first-choice appetizers due to the holiday.  Through process of elimination, we settled on potato skins, bruschetta, and onion rings.  Lots of deep fried options. My favorite: The onion rings.  Not too greasy or soggy. My least favorite: The bruscetta.  It was like a cracker with some chopped up tomato thrown on top. A few hours l",2

Are you a Pub or are you a restaurant? Most people know the difference. Employees: They hurry you along and then bring the check way too fast. Cleanliness: The place could use a good cleaning. Even the entrance way was dirty. Overall Recommendation: You could eat here, but there are so many other places that you make for a memorable meal.",2

I then orderd the parma proscuitto thinking it would be delicious, thin, light and salty like they do it in Parma Italy.  Essentially what came out was thin-deli cut ham, did not even taste like proscuitto, very disappointed.  We both took one small bite and did not even finsih it.

"I was generally not impressed by Giordano's. I was in town shooting a short film for a few weeks and the producer insisted on ordering Giordano's because he KNEW it was the best pizza in Chicago, and clearly we all know that producers generally know EVERYTHING. That being said, the pizza itself was somewhat lackluster in appearance, taste and texture. The crust was quite lacking in crispness and flavor, sort of a bland wheat crust that merely held everything together. It had a greasy taste to it as well, like cardboard with canola oil slathered on it. The sauce was applied in a very thin layer, and was barely present in the overall taste of the pie and the fats in the cheese really overpowered any acidity in the tomato sauce. So it tended to not cut through overall and would certainly be o",2

The third time that I ate there it took so long to get our food that we asked for a to go container with it, because my 1 hour lunch was over before any of our food arrived.

As I approached the register one of the employees sauntered over from the back of the restaurant. Her heals were dragging so loudly that I giggled to myself. I asked if I could get food to go and after a barley audible 'uh huh' i ordered a bacon cheeseburger. She informed me that they were out of bacon (what?!) and it could only be a cheeseburger.

After finding a veggie burger on the menu and being assured there would be wireless, I nabbed a table with an outlet by myself and settled in to get some work. Now, here's where I made a rookie mistake: I ordered before confirming there was wireless. Because there definitely wasn't but at that point I had to stay or pay for a meal I didn't eat. Cue anger.

I've never eaten 'authentic' Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza and was pretty excited at the prospect. I've always enjoyed thicker crust pizza and from the praises and aesthetic of the Chicago pie, what's not to like. The execution of this beast of a pizza was quite bad by any means. There was just way too much going on, and none of it good. Too cheesy, up to a point where it was hard to eat. I imagine a depp dish crust to be crisp buy yet chewy with a nice give.

This turned out to be smart choice since I only made it through 3/4 of my personal pie. That is to say, it was quite filling and tasty too I might add. Service at this place wasn't anything to sing home about, but I guess you can't expect exceptional service at a pizza joint.",3

HOWEVER, our waiter was a complete snob and very rude- hence, the 3 star review.  He wouldn't even offer a suggestion on the menu when I asked what his personal favorite entree was!  It is one thing to attend to your guests and provide excellent service, but that doesn't mean you can't lighten up, gauge the personality of your table and act accordingly. I would go back again, I have only been there once.  But I'm not raving because our waiter was a total jacka*s.",3
"I went here a bunch of times during the 2 weeks of staying in Hotel71, which is right down the street from one of their locations. Pretty much it's regular bar/ pub food. Burgers and wraps with regular appetizers like quesadillas. The food is nothing special, but really hits the spot if you're hungry and in a rush to eat. The food always came out quickly and well prepared. My main problem with Elephant & Castle is the wait staff. I went about half a dozen times and had a different waiter/ waitress each time. You would think that at least one of them would have given us good service, sadly that did not happen. Each time our waiter/ waitress forgot something, the silverware, the drinks, our appetizer. It wasn't terribly busy any of the times I went, so the mishaps can't be blamed on an over ",3
"it's a 'meh' for me. i got a turkey burger and it wasn't all that great. they give you a lot of fries...they are good...but there are better fries out there. the strawberry shake was good though...real good! i'm not going to go out of my way to go here, but if i am hungry i might stop in and try a chicken breast or regular burger.",3
"No no NO. We come to Chicago for the city, the architecture, the lake, the FOOD. And we go to places like this, HIGHLY recommended to us by others, others in whom we blindly have faith. No no no. A disappointment this was. And REALLY it was. I don't like soggy crust. I don't like preserved alfredo sauce that turns to goop after 2 minutes on the table. I don't like waiting ONE AND A HALF hours to be served an OK pizza. NO.",3
"Deep dish pizza is of course a staple of any tourist visit to Chicago, but somehow the pizza at Giordano's did not leave a lasting impression on any of us. While it is undeniable that we love pizza, something about having to wait thirty to forty minutes for a pizza that is basically a lasagna with a crust seemed less than appealing to me. On our lunch visit, we ordered a twelve inch diameter medium special, which includes sausage and mushrooms with green peppers and onions, for our group of three and none of us could stomach the amount of cheese loaded into each bite of the pizza. Honestly, there is nothing about the pizza that a picture would have trouble communicating, but at the minimum, it was nice to have a waitress that understood our pain of eating the amount of cheese we did. And i",2
"I love pizza but I like them deep dish style. So when I got to Chicago, deep dish pizza was on top of the priority list. Getting lost on the street of Chicago, my friend Kathy and I came upon groups of hungry people waiting to get seated outside Giordano's. We immediately decided that this is the place to try! The hostess adviced us that we should order after 45 mins of waiting. Hungrily, after 45 mins, my friend and I ordered the Antipasto Salad and a smallest size pizza, 10 inches stuffed spinach pizza. After that, we waited another half an hour, which meant we waited an hour and half for pizza. Starving as I walked to the table, I thought to myself, this better be good! The Antipasto Salad came with imported ham, Genoa salami, Provolone cheese, black olives, red onion, pepperocini peppe",3
"Great for having some cold ones after a final or a Thursday night class.  I definitely did that a handful of times here in my DePaul days.  The food is average.  They have pretzel rolls for their burgers, but the deep dish is a little...odd.  The crust is more of a shell than a crust, if that makes sense.  Tomato sauce too runny.  Not a bad place.  They offer DePaul discounts, which is nice.  If I ever go to school again...at DePaul's loop campus...I'd go again for the beers alone.",3
"I love Jamba, but it seems every time I come in this location I get forgotten about, and skipped over by the masses that crowd this little shop. I'm almost 6ft tall with red flipping hair...How can you forget about me so much!?   You make me mad, but I love berry fulfilling...so keep them coming :)",3
"Besides being in a dungeon, I really can't complain about this place.  The falafel sandwich is good, not great.  The chicken sandwich was also good.  The service is sweet, although confused on how to use a KGBdeal.  I wouldn't really come here that often because I like windows, but it's not bad if you want decent, cheap food.  I wanted some baklava but you know, the calories from the falafel fit my quota for the meal.  Anyway, I am sure it was delicious.",3
"we had never heard this place but read many good reviews. we ventured in with groupon in hand for lunch. firstly, amazing deal for lunch! $15 for 3 courses! corn chowder - yummy cesar salad - too fishy gnochi - homemade & great tortellini - slighty salty chocolate cake - yum creme brulee - slighty runny such a great deal!",3
"Ok....so the pizzas are huge, make sure you order appropriately. Their 1-2 people will feed two people easily, even if they have large appetites. The pizza itself...well it's good. Very cheesy, nice enough sauce. Didn't love the crust though - a bit too pastry-like. I have had better stuffed pizza other times I have been to Chicago, but this was very good and I definable enjoyed it, so would be a fine introduction to the genre if you are close by. Go good, not great. As others have noted, the stuffed pizzas take 30 mins or so to cook, and a long time to eat as well so not fast food!",3
"Epic Burger was not as epic as some people had raved about. My turkey burger was not as greasy as I expected it to be and the taste was pretty good. The fries was one of the best i have had from a burger joint and the smoothie was delicious. I love how simple the menu is. It was definitely worth the coupon i got from Daily Deal Chicago. It's not the best burger but at least it tasted fresh and healthy. Now move over, Five Guys.",3

"I pop into Jaffa whenever I work in the 'Concourse', a.k.a. the 225 W. Wacker building. This is one of those places that has a sort of limited menu, but everything they do is done well. Bagels and coffee - with a smile and a flirt! Turkey sandwiches - seem to be their specialty, what with the giant carcass of the unwitting bird on display - yuuuuummy and giant. Juice bar - nice, and hard to find a no-frills one like this, v. nice.",3
"Great little Chinese take-out on Randolph and Wells.  Looks like trailer (and really small inside) but the food is good and orders come out very quickly.  Waiting for warmer weather before I try the frozen/smoothie drinks.   So far: Sesame Chicken with Egg Roll - broccoli a little soggy but maybe due to delivery instead of pickup.  Sauce was tasty and the meal actually lasted me for two lunches. Hot & sour soup - pretty standard - I think theirs is vegetarian though so lacking some of the flavor and ingredients (no woodear, meat, etc.) Potstickers - a bit greasier than usual and less crunchy than I like (one side crisp / one side soft) - the sauce could use a bit more ginger.",3
"As sports bars go, this place is good.  And desperately needed in the South Loop area.  However, my last trip here was just so-so.   The food portions are huge.  I think most people would love this, but I'm completely tired of this fad.  You don't impress me by giving me more than triple the appropriate serving size.  You would impress me by using fresh ingredients that speak for themselves.  But again, it's a sports bar, it's pretty much on par with the type of food you'll get at any other sports bar (read: everything covered is some type of mystery 'ranch' sauce).   The beer selection IS great.  Thank you for carrying more than the standard yellow bubbly piss (read: any of the Bud products). Ask for a table in the back.  Anywhere near the door and you will freeze in the winter.  The poor",3
"If you want to have Chicago's famous deep dish pizza - this is where to have it. I'm personally not much into pizza but this was not so bad. It's very filling - one slice will have you stuffed. The only thing though is I wish they had alfredo sause pizza instead of the usual tomatoe sauce. All in all, if you're a pizza fan, try it out.",3
"Looking for a place in the Loop to grab a burger, beer and a shot?  Then Emerald Loop could be just your kind of place. While I didn't eat here- my friends did and they said their sandwiches were okay.  The menu has a range of Irish and American favorites.   From my viewpoint- the beer was cold and there's a nice choice on tap.  They do a strong pour of Whiskey and the bartenders kept an eye out for any empty glasses that might need refilling. All okay in my book. Interesting mix of people, from professionals, to ball 'leaguers' to people coming from the nearby theater district.   While it may not be a regular hang out for me- it's just good to know that there is another choice in this part of the Loop.",3
"This pub is great for the after work crowd.  It gets a tad crowded and the prices are a bit inflated.  but all in all it is what it is.  The wait staff is friendly but they should be with the tips that I see some of these business fellas laying down.  The food is top knotch however don't expect to be blown away with variety.",3

"Yeah it was A-ok and tried coz everyone suggested that I should check out deep dish pizza - the signature item of city of 'Revolving doors'.. Took about 45 minutes to get our special small sized deep dish pizza.. Lots of mozzarella and less meaty.  Fried zucchini was heavenly.  Would suggest the appetizer platter if you are a big group.  Tried their pizza and got out with their Tshirt as a souvenir :-)",3
"My fiance and I came upon this place after a long and weary trek to the top of the Sears (er, I guess I mean Willis) Tower. I very much appreciated they were there and open, since the next best options seemed to be McDonald's. I also appreciated that they make it clear it's going to take a long time to get your pizza, so we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and devoured it while waiting for the pizza. The dip was good, though I'm not sure it was stellar - although I was hungry so it was fantastic! Hmm, the pizza. We ordered the stuffed pizza with fresh tomatoes and pepperoni, but really they sell a cheesy-stuffed cheese pizza - there were about 4 slices of tomato on top of the pizza and I found 2 pieces of pepperoni in my slice, so you might as well just order the cheese pizza. It's stuffe",3
"Although I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish pizza, I do enjoy Giordano's cheese deep dish pizza every now and then.  They have individual sized pizzas that are the perfect size for a lunch and they are perfect if you want to split it with a friend.  My friend and I usually split a salad and that pizza and we are good to go.  The pizza is delicious and not overly greasy and the salads are decent.  The location is great for a working lunch but does tend to be crowded during prime lunchtime hours.",3
"Breakfast buffet here is a decent value at $22pp.  Great omelet station and lots of fresh fruit.  The cooked food, especially the breakfast sausage and hash browns, is ok too.  The ready-made pastries are more of a miss, and similar to the Costco variety. Service is good, atmosphere clean and quiet.  I probably wouldn't come again due to the options available in the area, but it's not bad!",3
"Went here today for lunch upon the suggestion of a co-worker.  I was craving some good pastrami, and I've been meaning to try Perry's, but I heard it's a mountain of meat, but I'd go for it if it was really good pastrami....so ok, Goodwin's sounded like a good compromise.  Except NO PASTRAMI!!! What kind of deli place doesn't have all the major meat groups, I ask you!?  Sigh...oh well.  They did have turkey pastrami, which probably would have been ok. I decided to play it safe and get a Turkey Sandwich with guacamole and multi-grain bread. All in all, the igredients were fresh, but it was kind of lack-luster.  I did enjoy the multple side options and the service was friendly overall.",3
"Taste: It was okay.  Thought the burger meat needed more salt or flavor or seasoning.  Something was definitely missing even though I had lettuce, tomato, Epic sauce, grilled onions, AND fried egg on my burger.  Maybe I needed cheese AND bacon too? Freshness:  Excellent.  Thought the meat and fixings were pretty fresh. Price:  Expensive for what I got. Fries:  Pretty good.  Similar to Five Guys.  They give you a decent amount of fries with the order. Overall I would go back and give it another try IF I'm in the area and feel hungry.  Sadly I was not blown away by it.",3
"Went to Giordanos back in September. I had pretty high expectations for this place because of all the hype. Unfortunately I ended up pretty disappointed and was not too impressed with the pizza at all. I definitely think NYC pizza tastes way better. Sorry Chicago, but NYC definitely kick butt in regards to the pizza department. What we ordered: 2 deep dish pizza. One with ham and pineapple and the other with mushroom and pepperoni. The pizza was way too doughy and there wasn't enough sauce. The cheese tasted pretty good but that was about it.   The line for this place was super long so we ordered take out but ended up sitting near the bar. I am not sure if we had to put our name down for those seats but we just sat down and since no one said anything to us, we just ordered a few drinks and",3
"So if you added up all of the reviews on all of the locations of Jamba Juice around the city, you'd probably have a bazillion 5-star reviews.  I'm not faulting, the smoothies are great.  I'm a simpleton and the Strawberry Nirvana is perfection.  My curiousity about this secret menu is peaked but that will have to wait until next time... I'm reviewing the food today... I got a Groupon and was really excited to try a flatbread (who knew they had an oven?) and found out the Groupon didn't cover it.  So I had a choice of wrap, sandwich or salad plus a smoothie drink.  I went for the Asian Chicken wrap and wow ,was it bland.  Not bad, per say.  Just not really great.  Or even good.  I would probably make a face if I had to eat one again.  I was hoping for a new, healthy-ish food place for lunch",3
"Came here on a late night whim on a very, very cold Chicago night. The nachos were pretty good, drinks were strong, but I was surprised at how empty it was, I guess its more popular with the after work crowd. There's nothing new on the menu here, but its a good option and nice additon to the Loop...certainly beats the chain dining that tends to dominate.",3
"Working around the corner makes this place attractive. Good food, large restaurant and bar.  Pizza and sandwiches are great. Nice service, fast and efficient. I had the lent specials before, should have gotten the blackened catfish.  Unfortunately, I had the fish fry, which I've had here before. Today, not as good, dry, weird breading. No the best Otherwise a 4 star joint.",3
"The dish I ordered tasted really good though I felt it was a little on the overpriced side. My wife enjoyed her dinner but mentioned that the cherry tomatoes were a little too acidic. The wines we ordered (both red) were also a little overpriced, although I know now that the price of a wine glass at restaurants is typically the price of the bottles themselves when bought at wholesale by the restaurant. For desert we shared an order of tiramisu which was excellent. The service was a little too attentive, particularly at the end. I've seen bad reviews for this place but I can admit that I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and would return",3

"A great lunch spot in the loop, but it's usually pretty packed.  I would recommend coming in a little early or after the noon rush.  That said, their dishes are a great change from the normal sandwich/soup/salad joint.  I've never been disappointed by the food, but sometimes the service is less than can be desired.  I am always jealous of the people that seem to be able to drink at lunch... I have been more than tempted to join them or at least have a drive by shot on the way back to the office, but those damned morals kicked in.  We have gone here after work, and well, those morals are non-existent after 5pm...",3
"There is a history here.  A history of restaurants that have catered to the business and tourist crowd alike over the many decades that a restaurant has occupied this space on Wabash.   Exchequer, however, kind of left me feeling flat the other night, but maybe they were just having an off night.  My regular haunt in this 'neck of the woods' is Millers Pub located one block north so when I wandered in here, it had a pretty high benchmark to hit as I like Millers. There were a couple of hiccups along the way.  First, when we we were seated, no one came to take our order.  I finally flagged down a person who ask who was our server and she said it was her.  So we placed our order for a pizza and a couple of drinks. She said it would take 30 minutes for a pizza trying to suggestive sell us an ",3

"We went here for a Sunday lunch.  The parking is usually okay for Sundays around here and it is very close to all kinds of public transportation and a very short distance to Millennium Park.  There was hardly anyone in there - probably because it was a Sunday.  The fish and chips were just okay- I have gone to a different location and they seemed better. Kid Friendly - for the most part.  They do have high chairs and were accommodating (but, it wasn't busy).  There is a limited kids menu with a few items.  The only part?  No changing table in the bathroom.  Noise level seemed fine to have my son, but he was being pretty quiet too.",3
"Came here for a light dinner and drinks with a vegetarian coworker.  Bad choice for a vegetarian. We ordered a share plate of sweet potato fries, pub pretzels, and veggie spring rolls.  (Don't even get me started on why Irish & British pubs serve Asian food...).  All the apps were pretty meh, but I stuck with vegetarian items to be nice, so maybe that's not a fair assessment. The Big Ben Brownie made up for it, simply delicious. Stella drafts were on special for $5, which was nice. Nice decor and great staff; our server Raheel was always there to ask if we needed anything.  We definitely overwelcomed our stay, but he was nice to check in on us once in a while after dessert. Convenient location; I'll have to give it another try with some carnivores.",3

"After many, many recommendations of 'best pie places in Chicago', for our last dinner meal before returning to D.C., we opted for Giordano's, because we heard it was supposed to be 'the best of the best', and also because it's practically a stone's throw away from the Hyatt. Two lessons I have taken away from that meal: Lesson One - when somebody tells you to bring your appetite to Giordano's and NOT to have any appetizers beforehand, LISTEN TO THEM. And Lesson Two? The 'best stuffed pie' debate may continue to rage on, but it's all fairly subjective.  I can't say that a bite of Giordano's generously endowed 'small' pie (and I use the word 'small' facetiously) had me shouting to the rafters for joy, but for what it is, it's a pretty damn good pie.  I just wish we hadn't had chicken fingers",3
"Pizza has to be one of my favorite foods. So it's takes a lot to disappoint me in this category. After giving  Giordano's a few tries they have done the impossible by disappointing me. For all the hype this place gets, the pizza did not meet expectations. The tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza was overwhelming and didn't taste fresh. I had to drink a lot of water after my first slice because the bread was so thick and dry. When you bite into it feels like you are just biting through layers. The tomato sauce, cheese, and bread doesn't feel integrated. Their thin crust however was solid. But its hard to mess up a thin crust pie. The wait staff are very nice. Overall the pizzeria is average. I don't sit at home and drool thinking about this place. I would only come back if friends invited me",3

The diner theme is great and the space is airy and classic (a treat for your parents if they grew up in Chicago).  But many items on the menu are just  a bit off.  I grew up on latkes with a Lithuanian grand mother and mother, and their homemade potato pancakes were amazing!  What they serve as latkes here are not what I remember, nor do my parents.   The sandwiches can be a bit much as well if you don't usually ingest 3,000 calories in a sitting.  The open faced reuben has so much cheese on it you can't even see the meat.  This might be heaven for some, but its just not my style. This is not to say that I don't return here.  There is enough on the menu to satisf",3

The waitress looked at me a little funny when I asked for a chocolate one and said that was the only kind they made. Umm, Vanilla egg creams are really good too. And for the skeptical, there's no egg in it. it's chocolate/vanilla syrup, milk, and seltzer. When I am old and decrepit, I will have my IV drip of coffee replaced with egg cream. yum.

"We live a few blocks from Gioco--easy walking distance-- so end up eating here more often than we would if we lived driving distance.  In fact, I'm not sure how often we'd eat here if it were less convenient.   The decor is typical  trendy--exposed brick walls, high ceilings with all the mechanicals exposed, very loud background noise.  You also run the risk of being seating along the railing, which means that another party is either directly above or below you.  I've wondered why they don't stagger those tables, like theater seats.  Probably they can cram more in this way.  You can also get stuck next to the open kitchen, which is either interesting or annoying depending on your take.

"I used to love visiting Jamba Juice regularly before work. Back when they used to do daily specials like Ideal Meal Monday for $3 and Oatmeal Wednesdays for $1. However the franchise has now gotten rid of these promos and only does email blast coupons maybe once a month.

Plus with a different one every day of the week no matter what you like to purchase at Jamba you could find the day that has that on special. Are the smoothies good, yeah there fine.

"Ahhh yes...Exchequer...a loop bar...It's been a couple of months, but seeing the title pop up, I had to wax nostalgic. ;) Exchequer is located over in the east loop, by jeweler's row.  A good size place, it's not too hard to find.  There's plenty of hotels around, so for people visiting, it's a welcomed bar to sneak into.  If you're a local living downtown, this is one of the few late night options.  Luckily, the place gets it done.  Nothing fancy, but not a dive. The small bar up front is my preference for a seat, but there's a large two room dining area for 2 to many many people.  It's great for larger groups, especially with that second room that is rentable.  However, I enjoy the upfront bar where food is served and it's easier to walk up and get a refill. It's here where you can reall",4
"So far this is my favorite Chicago style pizza(better Gino's East, and def better than Lou Malnatis) I know i need to try a lot more. Anyways i'd prob only give it a 3.5 but I feel fine with 4 stars. I've never had great service at any Girodano's but average at best with it coming close to bad. The pizza is consistently good no matter how you order it or what toppings you get. The apps are consistently average, think frozen and flash fried.",4
"The food here was great! Pro's- - Food is definitely better here than any other 'diner' in the area - Wait staff was pleasant and attentive - The decor was very nice and classic Chicago diner style - Good sized menu with good variety & presentation - Desserts looked delicious Con's- - Owner was a pushy jerk.  Certainly makes you feel like you outstayed your welcome as soon as your table is clear - Expensive.  $11 omelettes and $13 burgers. - Could have long lines",4
"Epic Burger was, indeed, epic. I went with a couple of coworkers who recommended it. I'm going to suggest it next time I'm in a burger mood. Burgers come with lettuce, tomato, pickle, grilled or raw onions, and their special sauce, which seems to be a seasoned mayo. I generally dislike mayo on my sandwiches and burgers, but it actually works really well with the fries. I got the turkey burger on a wheat bun to convince myself that this was healthy. The patty was well-seasoned and I liked the toasted buns. Our food came out relatively quickly. In my opinion, the $5.99 price tag is pretty reasonable for a burger. I mean, the product is obviously better than McD's, and if you go to a sit down restaurant for a burger, it will run you more than that. It is really hard to find a solid lunch for ",4
"Went here last week for a party. They did a really nice job, I know they have a few bars so they know what they are doing. Its a big open space which is decorated very tastefully although I prefer a cozier bar. I have to admit I know 2 staff members,not that we hang out but we used to work together,so I am not going to comment on service!",4
"Tucked away in the Aon building area, I visit this, my 'home base' Giordano's, once a week (or order in) for stuffed pizza (half mushroom, half sausage) and a Chopped Salad. Yum. Go easy on the dressing that comes with the chopped salad: it's FIERCELY vinegar-y. This place can get reaallly crowded...probably tourists staying at nearby hotels. Only reason for no 5 stars? We've experienced some snarkiness on the part of the staff here...",4
"Gino's vs Giordano's Part II 'Overindulgence is a state of mind.  The stomach will ALWAYS accommodate, if the mind allows.'                                            - A very wise (and fat) man - That's right folks!  If you've tuned in, then you know that this is the sequel to the much anticipated head to head duel of Chicagoland's deep-dish pizza heavyweights.  Who will take the crown?  Read on to find out. Round 1- History: Per Giordano's own menu, the place first opened its doors in February 1974 by two brothers from the 'old country' who tried to recreate Mamma's recipe (aw, shucks).  Contrast this with Gino's tale (as noted on their lovely paper placemats) of two taxi-driving paisanos and their bud who got bored and opened the doors of their first pizzeria in 1966. Dilemma: old word ",4
"My fiance and I live in the loop and love this place as our 'corner' bar. It's a great location to watch a game be it baseball, football or basketball. If you're going to eat there, I highly recommend their pizza. It's perfect bar pizza but it actually has delicious flavor and you can tell how fresh it is by the way it's cooked and the toppings. They have a full bar there but I would recommend sticking to beer. Their cocktails aren't as inexpensive as they should be and are sometimes weak. Their beer selection is pretty good though and they sell pitchers which is always a plus in my book. During a commercial break, be sure to observe the people around you. The regulars in this place are like characters from 'Cheers' or 'The Simpson's'. Definitely a great people watching location!",4
"Really good quality food, much better than expected.  The burgers are fantastic.  Properly cooked and very tasty.  Lots of seating, too.  I've never had to wait.",4
"I am a HUGE pizza lover. If I could I would make all my favorite dishes into a type of pizza. My friends and I stumbled upon Giordano's when we took a road trip to Chicago. We heard about Chicago pizza, but didn't know what to expect let alone from this restaurant. We ordered the deep dish and it was really tasty. I did think it had a little too much tomato sauce, but I still finished a slice and helped myself to another.  How could a pizza lover resist another slice?!  We also ordered their mozzarella sticks and calamari for appetizer. Those were good as well. Perhaps I was just hungry, but their mozzarella sticks were extra good and extra cheesy. Our server was also very sweet, which made our experience awesome. I came here with not many expectations and I was not disappointed. I must ad",4
"I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but ultimately settled on 4 because I don't have much to compare my deep dish to.  The last time I had Chicago deep dish was about 10+ years ago.  Anyway.... We showed up a little after 6 on a Sunday evening Labor Day weekend.  Busy.  45 minute wait for 2 people.  But we spied 2 spots at the bar and took those instead of waiting for a table.  Best decision ever. The bartender was AMAZING.  He was so fun to watch, quick to respond to drink requests and so accommodating to the table drink orders as well as those of people waiting for tables.  He was one of the highlights of the meal, seriously. The pizza was delicious.  We got the SMALL special stuffed, it was MORE than enough for my boyfriend and I, and we took home 2 slices for leftovers.  As I continue to ",4
"I love me some Epic Burger! The place is LOUD due to the decor (high, high ceiling) and it is not advised then to try to take any calls if you eat in at this place. The food is great! The burgers are the 'thin' kind that you can tell are real meat that wasn't preformed and frozen. The fries are one of my faves and the cookies are yummy too.   I like that their stuff is biodegradable and their meet is humanely raised. All that said. the place is expensive. I don't bother paying more for cheese though they do sound yummy. I usually just get Epic sauce and grilled onions.   It is a nice treat now and again.",4
"Beautiful hotel with a modern round bar area for the wine room as you walk in. The flights menu was large & available in whatever combination as wished. The service was friendly & fast. We had a great time in the bar & really enjoyed their selection of cheese, wine & chocolate. Will go back for their eno-versity events on tuesdays!",4
"Eleven City Diner has been on my to-try list for the longest time....and I loved it! Best pastrami and corned beef I've had in Chicago. The milkshakes are also a-mazing. Atmosphere is bustling and fun, even on a week night.  I will definitely be back for brunch/lunch/dinner. The only thing I was disappointed in was their deli. I bought smoked sable for breakfast the next morning & it was $30/lb! They also didn't debone or slice it for me which was weird.",5
"The deep dish veggie.. Pretty damn good.  Not sure if I'd call it a pizza tho... but I have one almost every time I'm in Chicago. Atmosphere is whatever... like a sports bar meets a family restaurant, and it feels slightly touristy. I usually order to go.",4
"For a tourist attraction (even the bartender made a joke about being the only guy in there from Chicago - including the staff), Giordano's is remarkably charming and 'Chicago.' It is one of those places that you really have to hit once while you visit Chicago, because it is an Institution, and when you come back people say, 'Did you have pizza?' and you have to be able to say not only yes, but yes, at Giordano's. We haggled and finagled and ended up deciding to have jalepeno and sausage pizza, the traditional deep dish style, and we ordered ahead and funneled into the bar for a beer while we waited for a table. Standing there with my Newcastle, watching sports spin by on the TV, surrounded by the hubbub of patrons, I understood for the first time why people patronize tourist attractions in",5

"Wandered in here after the Shamrock Shuffle. Everything was really quick, which is great. We were seated right away, our waitress was very engaging and fast, and it was very comfortable. Decor isn't anything special, but, it has a warm, feel to it with a lot of history. The food was alright. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Alfredo. It was pretty tasty but I've had better... and worse. One thing I loved however, was that the waitress left a shaker of Parmesan Cheese at the table. Little things like that make me happy.",4
"I was inspired to host a Monday-night Bears game party in late December 2010, but not at my home. I walk a lot, so I may randomly dip into anything that looks  'new to me'. I spotted Jimmy Green's on south State St., took a 5-second look around, liked what I saw, and snatched a menu. I read the menu on the L and was impressed with the food options. It seemed like some effort was being made to provide interesting food for reasonable prices (as in a near-downtown value). So, it was the first place that came to mind for the party. After some e-mailing, a reservation was made. I got there a couple of hours early and Jeff was very accommodating to change the seating plan to fit my needs. I had asked for a booth, but there wasn't one large enough to allow my entire party to see the main screen e",4
"It was late on a chilly Monday night and I had no expectations. I had heard good things about this place and they advertise their four-star pizza, but I was too tired to care. My cousin and I ended up splitting an old hickory turkey burger while we waited for our small deluxe pan pizza (ha). The turkey burger was one of the best I've had and it took a bit of willpower to stop myself from stealing my cousin's half. I swiped the bacon pieces that fell onto her plate instead. As for the pizza . . . the small is huge and it came out hot, cheesy, and bubbly. After one bite, I was sold. While I can't really say that it's 'better' than the other deep dishes in the city, it's really darn good. Great crust flavor and consistency, great sauce, super great cheese (the quality is very good and there's",4
"I love the popcorn - that gets five stars. It's dirt cheap, too, which was a shock to me the first time I visited. This is one of those Chicago foods that I'm glad I didn't pass up after moving here! However, this location drives me nuts. There's not enough room for the amount of customers who come in here, and then people get confused as to what they're supposed to do sometimes. If you're by the Randolph location (on the corner, right next to Oriental Theater), that location is the bee's knees. Huge, ridiculously clean, and the employees don't seem like they hate you for coming in.",4
"I never knew about this place until my boyfriend asked me to meet him.  It's not too far from home so I was game.   Yes, this is a union bar mixed in with some 'ties'.  It is pretty lively mid-week to Friday.  I really appreciate how well I am treated by the bartenders.  They are always very pleasant and friendly to me.  In fact everyone has always been very  courteous and the guys offer up their seats. I never paid attention to what we were paying for my drinks, I just learned it is $10 a glass for cabernet.  I thought it was a bit much but hey, it's the city. I've never eaten here so I can't help there.  Overall I enjoy stopping in for a few and will continue to do so.  PS, their washrooms are very clean which is really important.",4
"Stopped in for a quick dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  The steak and blue cheese salad was very good, and they served a solid burger as well.  I wouldn't go out of my way to order the french onion soup again - but it was fine (definitely not as good as the rest of the food)  Service was efficient, and they have a very nice outside patio if al fresco is your thing. I can't wait to stop in again to try the steamed pretzels and a few pints as they have an amazing selection of beers (okay, I also want to bailey's Irish cream cheesecake as well :)",4
"The 'rents love this place when they come into town.  Me, I wouldn't visit the tourist plagued spot unless someone had a gun to my head. Regardless, that popcorn mix is damn tasty.  They really know how to coat on enough grease to make your taste buds explode!",4
"This totally was a five star experience until the end of the meal which will be explained later... Were sent here by Hilton Hotel when we asked about brunch options within walking distance... Staff was fantastic and friendly and even took my mom and friends luggage from us during our meal which I thought was over the top!   Waited about 30 minutes outside in comfortable chairs which is totally expected on a Saturday.   This restaurant has great energetic music playing and an easy to read menu.  I had a chicken salad, mom had an omelette, and friend has rueben.  They all came to the table quickly and all looked and tasted amazing.  I even asked for water and it was returned promptly!  Kudos!! We weren't rushed a bit and were given the check without fanfair.  At the end, a woman came up and ",4
"I love this place, it's atmosphere is fun yet quaint at the same time.  I have been here three times and have ordered the same meal each time - because it was so incredible.  I gave it 4 stars because, well 5 starts is a pretty serious thing, and I need to mix it up a bit and try more of their food before giving a 5 star. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try the next delectable dish.",4
"Again... a long Friday lunch.  These summer lunches are really helping me expand my foodie horizons, let me tell you.  One of the other two people had been here before and suggested we go take a long walk down Van Buren to State.  It was a nice day and I worked up a good appetite by the time I got there. The menu is pretty simple, they don't overwhelm you with tons of choices and crazy combinations.  I stayed pretty traditional and got the epic burger on wheat, no onions with aged cheddar.  I'm not a big condiments person so I, unlike my husband, don't douse everything in ketchup and ranch dressing.  The epic sauce was good when I could taste it but a little bit of a kick would have been awesome.   As someone else said below, the patty IS flatty, with a name like Epic I would have expected",4
"First of all, Dana ROCKS! She was our server tonight and was so down to earth, friendly and accommodating. It wasn't really too crowded so we were all able to pull up chairs to a little table and hang out. Really swanky, modern environment and relaxed vibe. I was really impressed with the drinks and the food. Everyone had a really good time and they had a live DJ too. It was a really nice place -it was probably one of the better hotel bars I've been to. More of a club vibe than a regular ole hotel bar. I enjoyed my experience there!",4
"BF loves Giordano's.  Being lactose intolerant, I figured I would indulge his love of deep-dish pizza while settling for a salad or sandwich. However...I decided to ask if I could get a pizza without the cheese, and the answer was surprisingly yes! Maybe it's not the same without the cheese, but it's not like I would know the difference.  I ordered mushrooms, so they put them in the layer where the cheese would have been.   I really liked it!  I had the house salad while we waited the 40 minutes for the pizza to be ready.  It was very fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette was flavorful. We came back for lunch a few days later and got the individual-size stuffed pizzas.  Definitely a great deal, and you can call in your order ahead of time so you won't have to wait once you arrive. Lactose-int",4
"This is my second review in as many days. Since their deep dish pizza made me a believer, I couldn't resist trying their ribs. Actually I had their BBQ ribs and chicken wing combo with waffle fries. Years ago I had ribs from Carsons and I was disappointed because they were not fall off the bone. Well the ribs at Exchequer did not disappoint. The ribs were fall off the bone. And although the BBQ sauce was tasty, I have had better ribs before at Smokey Joes in Aruba.  Still they were much better than Carsons. Now for the wings. They were dry wings, not buffalo like I am used to with a side of blue cheese.  These slightly larger than usual wings came with a side dish of the same BBQ sauce as the ribs. Come to think of it, it's probably better then mixing with blue cheese, but by the end of my",4
"From street view this establishment elicits an underwhelming impression.  The oversized letters and neon signs remind me of another installation of Jimmy John's.  It actually took a recommendation by a bartender in Cleveland, OH for me to give it a try.   The interior is a whole different experience - a glorious upscale hipster diner...er Jewish Deli.  Whatever you want to call it, the atmosphere and staff is pleasant and accomodating.  Although the food is somewhat traditional, the taste is anything but ordinary.  The Corned Beef and Pastrami Hash was as good as any I have had in this genre, but the Mexican Scramble is a dish good enough to get every time.  If you're a carrot cake fan, this is a 'perfect' rendition.   Would have given this 5 stars, but they need to add an extra server at ",4
"Deep dish pizza made fresh (or at least I assume so because it took about 40 minutes to arrive--though in all fairness, they warned us.). We had one deep dish pizza and one regular pizza. On a quick trip to Chicago, it's perfect to be able to eat some Chicago style deep dish pizza. The sauce is on top and the cheese and toppings below. The crust is really buttery, which is not my favorite, but for a bit of pizza and a different style, it's worth it.",4
"If Garret could make a candle, perfume, room fragrance thingamajig, I think my life would be complete. The first amazing thing about Garret's is the scent. A block away you know you are headed in the right direction. Even if you have no plan to stop, once you smell it, you have to wait in line. You HAVE to. The Chicago Mix is the best combo of salty and sweet.

Buy 2 bags if going back to work... a Small to share with the vultures, the Large for when you get home!",4
"I tried Gioco because of what the folks at Yelp have been saying. Wasn't disappointed! It had a warm buzz and great food. I had the papardelle pasta with roasted boar (thanks Kristin!) which was superb! The meat was soft and fresh. The tiramisu was just average though- its the heavy kind, not the soft fluffy kind. Overall, this place is one to return to. What's stopping me for giving it 5 stars? The not-so-friendly hostess who DID NOT GREET ME at the door. And who fluttered her (false) eyelashes while trying (for a long 2 minutes) to find my reservation.",4
"An ex-bf brought me here for Valentine's Day. While the food was amazing, the wine pairings got me so drunk I don't remember the last 3 dishes of the 8 course, pre-set menu that night.   However, the service was great and everything was absolutely perfect. My only critique, is that the place is a bit hard to find, and considering that this is very fine dining (the check was over $800 for the two of us) you would think he could afford to remodel this place because the ambiance is very 1990s if you ask me.",5
"I love this location! There are a few more Giordano's in the Chicagoland area, but this one is the best in my opinion. Pizza is always made the way I love it. Deep dish is the way to go. You're in Chicago for goodness sake! Service is relatively good, so can't complain!",4
"I was so excited to eat here! I mean, it was amazing! Loved all the cheese and it was seriously so much food! So come with an empty stomach because I could barely finish 1 slice! It's a very popular place, but I was surprised that the wait was not too long, and it was definitely enjoyable.",4
"Recent visit to Chicago, stopped in to grab a bag. As soon as you walk close to the location you smell the delicious scent! As soon as i made it back to my hotel room i popped open the bag. My review: Its good! There's no denying that, but it's not 'Go out of my way, order online, ask someone in Chicago to bring me a bag back... ' Nope not that good.  However, if/when I'm in Chicago I'll make sure i pick up a bag. I have only tried the Chicago mix & i dont' wanna try anything else. Im addicted to that one. The downtown location had a crazy line, thankfully it moved quickly. Not sure why they wouldnt have more than one person at the register on a busy Saturday/holiday weekend?? I also stopped by the Navy Pier location for a sample and there were maybe 3 ppl ahead of me. I would go back to t",4
"I'd give this place 5 stars but some of their tables are insanely close together and makes things a little uncomfortable sometimes, so 4 stars it is. But Gioco is a great place. If you've walked by Gioco at night, then you know when you look inside that everyone's having a great time. I get a little jealous myself walking by when I have no one to go there with. I feel your pain. But once you're inside, it's awesome. Everybody loves Italian food and you won't find any surprises on the menu, but everything is prepared very well. I've always been a sucker for caprese salads, but the arugula and pear salad is where it's at. On the pasta side, you can never go wrong with the gnocchi. And for an entree, I'm always going with the veal. They pound that veal down and serve it up with prosciutto and",4
"Love love this place. I had a fierce craving for pho earlier and knew that finding a steaming bowl of beef soup deliciousness would be nearly impossible in the Loop. Thank goodness for Yelp (and for Tom and Angie X's review). Within 15 minutes, I was back at my desk and devouring the #9 steak pho. Mmm. I was also psyched to find that Green Apple offers up some of my favorite Korean dishes, like soondubu, chap chae, and bibimbap. A place that sells pho + Korean food + frozen yogurt is like something I would have come up with in my wildest dreams. Enough said. I still have to come back to try the Korean food, but I'm pretty sure I've found my newest fave lunch spot.",4
"We went here for Valentine's Day and it was so good!  The atmosphere is definitely very romantic!  The only problem I had was with the wine list.  While it's very extensive and classy there are only a couple of selections for wine by the glass, the rest of the choices you have to order by bottle.  I highly recommend the butternut squash tortellini, it was amazing!  They gave me a rose for Valentine's Day which was a nice touch :)",4
"It was 5pm and me and my friends wanted breakfast....THANK YOU Eleven City Diner. I got some really good pancakes for about 6 bucks. I also tasted the hash browns which were pretty damn tasty. I would've given this 5 stars except the tip was included for parties of like 5 or something so..be careful if you only have enough for what the menu says. The waitress was pretty nice by the way.

"Giordano's isn't exactly deep dish but it is my favorite non-thin crust pizza in Chicago.  Unlike Uno's, all Giordano's pizzas taste the same no matter which location you go to.  So nice to know it is always going to taste good! The problem with the pizza is that I can never have more than 2 pieces.  But lucky me that I always have leftovers the next day.",4
"The value here is great. The food was good relative to the price. The staff is friendly and the ambience is pretty cool. Next time I might try the brick oven pizza...i think thats what they were making. For some reason I had overlooked this place many times on my way to Opera or Zapatista and this day I decided to try something new and i was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't say there is anything special, but if you want a good solid meal in a nice place then give them a try.",4
"No frills just great pizza.  Not a huge fan of stuffed so I usually get the thin crust.  Its good and I would recommend it to anyone.",4
"Everything at Goodwin's is good, because everything at Goodwin's is fresh. It is ironic, to me at least, that Goodwin's is directly across the street from Perry's, notoriously one of the most unhealthy lunch places you can imagine. Not to say that I don't go there, because I do, but you know. Anyway I'm a personal fan of the egg salad on toasted wheat. I'm not telling you to get it but I would definitely get it if I were you. Whenever someone asks me for a good lunch spot in the Loop, I like to send them here, if only for their reaction. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. And what's going on with that fake cat under the table next to the bottom of the one staircase? Doesn't make any sense. Either way, tons of good stuff going on here.",4
"Today at work I am chained to my desk.  No bathroom breaks, no afternoon jaunts, nothing.  It is awful.  When it came time to order lunch, I called Goodwin's - a place in the loop I know will deliver to me, 'the prisoner.'  I almost burst into tears when the lady told me there was a 'minimum order' for lunch deliveries.  I told her I didn't care when it came, but I couldn't possible eat 20 dollars worth of food.  No one else is here to go in on the order. If the phone rings and I don't answer it, it's my head.  She put me on hold.  When she came back, we had a 'sister, I hear you' moment and she said she would tack my delivery on the end of the delivery man's schedule.  SO AWESOME OF HER. Goodwin's is pretty money.  The ingredients are fresh and there are no surprises when it comes to your",4
"Oh...my...gosh...this pizza...is like no other. Oooey, and gooey cheesy goodness filled with pepperoni and whatever else you want to put in there. And let me tell you, one slice is PLENTY. But, it is completely good and a must try. Keep in mind though, that you have to wait 45 minutes for the pie to cook, so I suggest ordering a few apps to go with it. Since the pizza is so heavy, we had the Greek Salad which was an enormous plate and enough to feed the 2 of us. Our service at this particular location was okay, nothing to really review about. We came in late, around 10pm so that could have had something to do with it. I'll have to try the thin crust next time I'm in the great city of Chicago.",4

"People love Goodwin's. After coming here twice, I still didn't understand why. But yesterday . . . after I ordered a montecito and my friend ordered a laguna and we split the garden salad with vinaigrette . . . I finally understood why. Goodwin's is just good, wholesome, fresh food that's somehow put together in a delicious way. Most of their stuff is pretty darn healthy, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's pretty darn tasty as well. I'm not sure why it took this long for Goodwin's to grow on me. Maybe because I'm a steak and potatoes kind of girl and healthy food makes me a little sad. Or maybe because I didn't choose the right things before. Whatever the case, I'm no longer sad. I shall return.",4
"Great.  This deep dish has the best crust, in my opinion of 'the big three' (Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's) - it is flaky in a good way, and adds just a bit of crunch to the otherwise gooey and squishy pizza. The sauce is sauce, not puree (like Gino's East) or stewed chunks (like Lou's), but has good flavor and just a bit of acidic bite.  The famous upper-crust is there if you look, but honestly, I don't taste or feel it when I eat it, and if I didn't look for it, I'd never know it was there.  The cheese, of course, is excellent as well.  This is perhaps the thickest slice of the big three deep dish pies. On a negative note, this location is stingy with toppings.  My recent visit included both Italian sausage on one pie and pepperoni on another.  There were, sadly, perhaps two",4
"I love the popcorn - that gets five stars. It's dirt cheap, too, which was a shock to me the first time I visited. This is one of those Chicago foods that I'm glad I didn't pass up after moving here! However, this location drives me nuts. There's not enough room for the amount of customers who come in here, and then people get confused as to what they're supposed to do sometimes. If you're by the Randolph location (on the corner, right next to Oriental Theater), that location is the bee's knees. Huge, ridiculously clean, and the employees don't seem like they hate you for coming in.",4

We've experienced some snarkiness on the part of the staff here...",4

"Everyone remembers their first time. No, I'm not referring to your first sexual encounter. I mean, we ALL remember our first sexual encounter - good or bad. Mine was typical, I guess. At the conclusion, she was sobbing uncontrollably, followed by occasional dry-heaves with a frequent, 'I can't believe that something could be so small,' thrown in. Ahhhh, to be 26 again. Anyway, I was in Chicago in Sept. of '06 visiting some relatives of The Woman That I'm Currently Married To. After a full day of exploring the city and at the same time avoiding getting stabbed in the head with a screwdriver (I don't drink), we were pretty hungry. We came upon this establishment when TWTICMT mentioned to me that I would like it. The place was pretty empty (it was in the late-afternoon during the week) so we ",4
"As my first trip out to Chicago, I knew I definitely had to hit up a deep dish pizza spot. Giordano's is very close to the Fairmont Hotel so we took a short stroll on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. The wait for a party of four took about ten minutes; not bad. The restaurant is classic and spacious. One look at a medium deep dish pizza and the boyfriend and I knew we were going to order a small. We had sausage and jalapenos, a very scrumptious combo. After two slices each on a small, we still had two slice leftover. It takes about 30-40 minutes for the pizza to bake so prepare on waiting. But so worth it. Every bite was yummy till I couldn't take another.",4

My suggestion is to arrive right at 11 because this place fills up fast...otherwise, $6 and a 6 block walk will turn Giordano's into a normal lunch spot for me...",4
"This unassuming little spot is quickly working its way into my regular lunch rotation. I have never ordered from the deli counter, because I can't seem to get past the salad bar and hot food table. The salad bar isn't enormous and the options aren't endless, but it is fresh and clean, and there are a few items that really stand out. The grilled chicken strips do not taste like the frozen kinds that come in a bag, they taste like they are grilled and sliced in house that day. The avacado in vinagarette is awesome, as others have mentioned. they offer a few different choices for greens including romaine, spinach, and spring mix and I have yet to find any wilty, soggy, brown pieces in any the varieties. This is impressive! It just seems like someone here is really paying attention to quality ",4
"Not even a whole block away from the job so it should be a no-brainer that this be my go to spot for afterwork drinks. Actually I have been here only 3 times in the 3.5 years I have worked so close to it. Usually a suit & tie crowd or at least slacks and shirts. Drinks can be a little expensive here so maybe thats the reason I don't frequent. All 3 times I have been I have stumbled out in a drunken state, so I definitely recommend this joint if you work nearby. By the way, this place is connected to the Allegro Hotel",4

I freaking love deep dish.  I love the pie like crust with the meaty sauce and thick cheese.  This place is so damn good. I have had some of the top reviewed places in NYC and there is no comparison to Giordano's.  I have had Pizzeria Uno and while I really enjoyed it I still prefer Giordano's. I am interested to try Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Pequod's Pizzeria.  But they will have to wait for the next trip.",5
"As I promised..and update...so I went here on a Saturday night around 8pm, some of the NBA playoff games were on, and this place was pretty packed..not to the point where you couldn't move, but most tables were full and the place had a decent noise buzz (unlike the Monday night that I visited last).  This time we had food..and I must say, I was quite impressed.  The eggplant sandwich is super tasty (messy but really good), and the caprese sandwich was also awesome.  The sweet potato tater tots are like an appetizer and dessert all in one.  The beer list is awesome, and they have table toppers where they can give you a your own pourer of beer for the table, needless to say the guys loved this.  Plenty of TVs, pretty decent service, clean and friendly.  This place is fantastic!",4

Anyway, with a pizzeria being a stone throws distant from home I decided to begin my Chicago experience with Giordano's! I ordered for a special deep dish with add on of Canadian bacon. It takes about 30mins for the pizza to be made so one can wait either at the attached bar or as I did, watched the pizza makers do their thing! It can be quite entertaining to watch them make those pizzas so gracefully! I was pleasantly surprised to find how huge the pizza actually is. Little did I imagine before ordering, that gobbling the pizza by myself was a joke! The portions are very generous and since they don't sell by the slice; you will have to buy a full pizza. The",5

I have eaten in the restaurant many times and have always had great experiences.  I mostly get it delivered and get the same response, 'Your pizza will be there in an hour.'  It never has taken an hour!  Not even on a Friday or Saturday night!

I had The Great Rueben, and wow, it's an accurate title.  The corned beef was perfect, the sauer kraut was German goodness reincarnate, and the size made the price worth it.  I paid $11.38 for the reuben sandwich, chips, a long slice of pickle and a fountain drink plus soft serve ice cream.  The fountain drinks are $1.99 and all you can",5

"I'm an outsider who recently came to Chicago to visit a friend. One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's. Giordano's came out on top (although Lou Malnati's was a very close second). Quite simply, the pizza was delicious. The defining mark of Giordano's is the cheese overload. We're talking massive, overwhelming quantities of mozzarella that will send you into a state of deep bliss. Unless you don't really like cheese, in which case this pizza would be horrible. But if you're a cheese lover like myself, it really doesn't get any better than this. The other toppings and the crust are also very good, but the cheese - oh god, the cheese - is what really brings this home. We came h",5

This is a great place for hangover food or if you're looking for an ambient piece of old Chicago. Terrific pickle and green tomato plate as well.",5
"I know that visitors to Chicago always want to go to Gino's East, but Giordano's has the best pizza in the city!This particular location is great because it's near CTA, South Shore and Metra.  It's also near Millennium Park and has a view of the beautiful courtyard at Prudential Plaza.  On a nice day - or if the restaurant is extremely busy - you can get your meal to go, complete with utensils and plates, and have a picnic in the courtyard or the park.",5
"I've been in here a couple times...First off they have a Good Selection of beers, and I'm not talking about bud, bud light miller or any other swill. They have GOOD beers ie: Guinness,Harp, Fullers, Smithwicks ect...  The Atmosphere is nice it really does resemble an old English pub. The food however is better than most English pubs or at least the ones I've been too.  They have a lot of traditional English fair such as Bangers and Mash, Shepard's pie, bread pudding (which is absolutely amazing!!!!) and also burgers and chicken fingers (beer battered) All in all, a great little Pub.....Bang On!",5

But watch out - if you don't get a smoothie from the englightened side of things, even though it's all natural you're still looking upwards of 400 calories for a medium. My favorite? Strawberry Nirvana with an immunity boost, and a burner boost to get the metabolism rockin' in the morning . . . can we say GO?",5

"This location is a hidden gem in the windy city. We were walking around the city and decided to have pizza. We called ahead to the other location near the Sears Tower and they said they didn't take reservations so we called this one up and they took our pizza order and by the time we walked over, the pizza was ready and we were served. It was sooo good. One slice goes a long way!",5
"What can I say - 'the mix' is the best popcorn creation ever.  We bought a giant bag and were eating cheese/caramel mixed-up goodness even a week later.  It was really good for the first 4 days, then became a war of wills between the popcorn and me.  I won, but not without a fight.",5
"The cheese deep-dish was the best slice of pizza I've had in probably a year. The service was absolutely perfect.",5
"The Best Stuffed Pizza in Chicago. It just is. Gino's, Uno and Due, Lou Malnati's? Please. You guys 'coulda been a contender', but ended up being mere pretenders to the title.   Giordano's wins. Can be slow, of course it takes a long time to bake the deep-dish pizzas, but the service itself is also sometimes slow. Giordano's is a fairly large chain of restaurants with about 40 locations in the greater metropolitan area, and some other places as well.   So it's somewhat formulaic, if you have seen one then basically you have seen them all. However the uniform quality also means that you know in advance that it's going to be really good.",5
"Love me some Giordano's. Chicago style pizza at it's finest. There really isn't much that needs to be said about it.",5
"Ahhhh....This is my favorite pizza in the whole wide world. I go to a lot of Giordanos (including this one, Midway airport location and Franklin & Randolph) but have been to this one the most. The stuffed sausage is my favorite along with the stuffed Spinach also. Their thin crust pizza is pretty good as well. They have a bar if you are interested in having a drink.During lunch you can get a personal pizza to go which is always great if you are in a hurry, but you can't get it after 5PM. T This place always hits the spot and will always have the best pizza in Chicago! Mmmm Mmmm Good!",5
"Man, this place is damn good. I found about it through Yelp thanks to someone's handy list of places to eat for lunch downtown. It was kind of a hike from my office, but from the reviews I read I had a feeling that this place and I were meant to be. The entrance is a little tricky and I definitely looked like a rookie trying just to get inside (tip: go with the door that leads downstairs). Everything on their menu looks delicious, but I love the option of building my own sandwich so that's what I went with, and the person I was with had the 'Scottsdale' which was really just a Reuben. Both of our sandwiches were so good, the ingredients were super fresh and they made it all in a jiffy. The prices were also totally reasonable, our entire delicious meal (2 sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, and 2 ",5

"I'm still in love. I was charged 2 different amounts on my credit card the other day, I called the place up, spoke to the owner and he told me to ask for him next time I come in. Well, I did today and he bought me lunch. Now I was only over charged a buck or so and yet he went above and beyond, even apologizing both on the phone and in person, I kinda dig that kind of integrity.",5
"Had lunch at Goodwin's last week and have recommended it to every one that I have come in contact with since.  The bread is fresh and pillow-ey.  The spicy aioli is creamy and full of flavor.  Seriously, go here. Be sure to check out the specials before ordering!  Seriously, go here.",4
"My favorite lunch spot in the loop.  Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious, and they are very good about modifications to the standard fare (as one who loathes sour cream, this is key).  The food is varied - sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc - so there is something for everyone.   I lean towards the wraps, which come with chips, salsa, and guac.  Personally, the salsa is a little spicy, but they always let me swap it for a guac instead.",5
"I purposely booked a trip to Chicago JUST for the deep dish pizza. I think i went into DDP food coma. This was the first (and best) place we stopped at. People will try to argue that Gino's East is better. It is not (it is good though) We just had the basic pepperoni and I loved everything about it. From the cheesiness, to the sauce on top, the crust....best part is, they deliver!",5
"Can I say, AMAZING!!! I love this place.  I had a turkey burger and my husband had a beef burger. The ingredients are all organic and you can taste it. They're just so simple. Meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions on a fresh baked bun. The bun its self is so yummy. Anyway, don't like writing long reviews so I'll just say this.........TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF!!!!!",5

Everest is by far the nicest restaurant I have ever been to.  The view is incredible (I've uploaded a photo).  The place was like a museum, though: everyone spoke in hushed tones, and the servers watched us like security guards, wearing suits and saying nothing as they stood with their backs to the wall.

First off, the food is very expensive for what it is.  Its a glorified diner - which means that lunch for two shouldn't be $65.  Way too pricey.  Service is mediocrity at its finest.  One may think to blame the wait staff for this, but alas, its really not their fault.  Look who they have to deal with on a daily basis.  Keep reading... The owner/manager, Brad Rubin, is a real character.  And by 'character', I mean 'prick.' He treats his employees like dog shit on his shoe.  That attitude translates to his patrons.

"OK.  We just got back to NY from Chicago last night and I just reviewed Glenn's Diner and Yolk (both very good) and I had to put my 2 cents in about this place too.  I saw Giordano's on TV and I have to say that THE PIZZA SUCKS here.  Even if I didn't think that NY pizza rules, the crust here was just awful and the tomato sauce tastes like the crap you get if you are dumb enough to order Italian food at a diner.  We went to Lou Malnati's a few days earlier and that was pretty good (for deep dish pizza, that is) as were the other dishes we saw people eating there.  Other people near us at Giordano's ordered other dishes and they looked just awful too (a plate of fried, really greasy looking appetizers, calamari that looked tough and hard).  I mentioned to my husband that I hoped that their ",1
"This place is bad. When I visited here the entire restaurant had one waitress covering all the tables @ around 5:30PM.  Granted there were only two tables when I walked in, but by the time I left (at around 7:30PM) there were at least 15 tables with only one waitress covering the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, the service was slow. Pizza itself is un-amazing.  Bland sauce combined with 'fresh' mozarella cheese and uninspiring bread.  If I were to make a pizza from scratch at home, my oven would make a better one.  I was hoping to taste the good 'Chicago-style' pizza, and what I got was something worse than Papa John's.

And today I even asked them to double check that it was right and it was STILL wrong! I think it's because no one who works there speaks English. And the worst part is that every time I've been there I have been the only person in the place (1:30-2:00ish).

"I was so excited for Eggy's. A diner within walking distance from my place. My daughter had gone and said it was wonderful. Well, fast forward to my visit. They changed the menu! Absolutely no original dishes. All I read about was their Benedict. Off the menu. We ordered their seasonal pancakes, multi berry. It was just a plain pancake, and moments later they brought to the table a dish with thawed frozen berries to pour over the plain pancake. That is terrible. Never again. Eggy's, why would you change a menu when the menu reviews were so positive? It's a shame.",1

"I've been a regular since they opened several years ago but the place is going down hill and I probably won't be back. I usually stop in before work for a coffee and a yogurt.  They used to make their yogurt  with fresh fruit but now use some sort of liquid substance with chunks of soft objects that may look like fruit but taste like sewer matter. I had generally liked the coffee in the past and the fact they have a variety of flavors. Though, I learned early on to never order the iced coffee. They keep a jug full of stale coffee in a fridge and serve it to you in a cup of ice. It's nasty. I also was very bummed out this morning when the cup of pumpkin coffee I received had no pumpkin taste at all but seemed to be some lame generic decaf. WTF?  It will be a long while before I give this pl",1
"I'm updating this because the last few times we've come here, the service was just atrocious.  Last time our waiter ignored us after we asked for the check and instead spent a good 15 minutes at his friends' table chatting them up.  They were two tables away from us.     Classy. The food is still decent, but honestly, you can do better O'Malley's.  Especially when I have to pay $6 a pint for Blue Moon.  Come on already. What happened?  Luckily, we found other places in the area with much nicer service and prices!!",1

"My family LOVES Chicago style deep dish pizza, but Lou's is still BY FAR our favorite.  I'd rate the pizza at Giordano's a 3.5, but I cannot give this location more than 1 star due to the terribly rude and/or incompetent service we received by more than 1 employee (and I am normally a very tolerant person!).  I guess since their location is so good and so many of their patrons are tourists, they feel they don't need to worry about providing a pleasant experience and good customer service or treating people with respect, as they probably get enough volume to be profitable!We were there in the afternoon between the lunch and dinner rush, so hardly any customers were there.

If you don't want people ordering beer then don't put it on the menu. God forbid someone ordered a beer at Everest. I was wondering if they were going to put my picture up on the wall as the first person to ever be so uncouth as to order a beer. Then it took 20 minutes for him to bring it to my table.

The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged.

We sat down and got a big basket of fries, that was nice, but they weren't anything to jump up and down about. Our pizza came and it was awful. The cheese was super thick, the pepperoni was almost non-existent and the sauce...well, actually, what sauce? Overall, I'd avoid the place if you want a good deep dish pizza and a clean glass to drink from. Also, I ordered a diet coke, tasted like carbonated water with food coloring. I had to order Sprite instead.",1
"I have always been a fan of Giordano's  and this review is NOT for their pizza, because it is always delicious, but it's for the treatment that we had. I ate here with a business convention group of about 10 people. It was in the middle of the day at around 2pm and honestly, we could not get our waiters attention even if we searched and asked around. We had two extra guests come and they were waiting for 20 minutes for the waiter to notice and bring extra chairs and plates. The thing is, they were not even busy so it doesn't make sense why it took another 20 minutes for our water to come. Maybe this location is not good or just this waiter, but it was just unacceptable service. but don't get me wrong, the pizza is always amazing, this review is solely for the service.",1

However, service is also a huge part of the fine dining experience, especially when the bill for food and 2 glasses of wine costs over $330. Sadly, Everest was THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD at a fine dining establishment. In most cases, the server would set the food down, say the name of the dish, then walk away with NO explanation of the dish whatsoever! In this type of setting, I like to know what I'm eating (i.e. descriptions of each element on the plate).

I was so excited that even the weird chemically cucumbery smell that hit me when I picked up the food didn't diminish my excitement. But it should've.

I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice! After another attempt to order a drink it w",1

What we actually got was a different story - they served the fries next to a bowl of chunky potato curry that was not very saucy. We actually asked our server if she was kidding us. Did they expect us to skewer the curried potatoes with our 'chips'? I ordered one of the winter special drinks - called a cinnamon toast. It tasted like very watery (bland) cider.

Me: 'What? I mean, yeah, but what?' , meaning - What? Him: 'Well you know - health code violations - I don't want any trouble.' Me, still pretty incredulous: 'Whaaat?'

The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary. Then the manager ripped the pizza out of my friend's hands and charged his card back and yelled 'THERE, now you can go wait somewhere else for your meal!!'.

They did not toast the bagel, but instead threw it on the grill with eggs being cooked for someone else.  Seemed gross. After I get the bagel and am walking down the street I notice no cream cheese on the bagel. Go back to this dump and they hand me a tub out of the fridge with cream cheese.

Once I ordered an omelet and when it arrived, it was sitting in a pool of butter. It was completely inedible because it was so saturated with butter. And don't get me wrong, I love me some butter. But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.' And then she walked away. So I wrung out my omelet, gnawed on my burnt toast, paid the expensive bill, and vowed to never return. Show owner comment »",2
"When I worked closer to this location, this was our de-facto place to order pizza for parties, or even to visit on a slow day. The problem? I do not care for their pizza, and the menu offers little else that's even remotely appetizing. This location is set up kind of cramped - we couldn't stop bumping elbows wherever we sat. Despite the close quarters, for whatever reason, every server we've had has somehow missed 2-3 people at a big table. Very odd. The thing that killed the outings was when we showed up with a reservation twice in a row, and they couldn't sit us all together - some were in booths, others were at a table in a different room...it was really awkward and irritating. Add to that, we had to shuttle plates of different pizzas to the other people in our party and practically had",2
"We arrived early for dinner (5:15) and had no trouble getting seated promptly. However, by 06:00 the place had practically filled up and I expect there was a long wait. Part of the reason for this is the waitress informed us the cook time for deep dish (DD) would be 35-45 minutes and since our son had never had DD before, he opted to try a peperoni and cheese DD. However, that pretty much puts anyone getting DD at 60-90 minutes minimum, so that explains the long waits and low table turnovers. It also encourages people to order the appetizers which we resisted to keep the bill down. We opted for a thin crust pizza and promptly scarfed it down as we had been walking all day. He said his DD pizza was good but I don't think he was a fan of all the cheese - DD is definitely an acquired taste. T",2
"Staying at the Fairmont nearby and wanting to try something distinctly Chicago, I ended up at Giordano's on my first night. I've never eaten 'authentic' Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza and was pretty excited at the prospect. I've always enjoyed thicker crust pizza and from the praises and aesthetic of the Chicago pie, what's not to like. The execution of this beast of a pizza was quite bad by any means. There was just way too much going on, and none of it good. Too cheesy, up to a point where it was hard to eat. I imagine a depp dish crust to be crisp buy yet chewy with a nice give. But this crust had the texture of a cookie / biscotti. Too god damn hard. I'm sure this doesn't represent Chicago pizza as a whole and may as well be one of those places where tourist such as myself go to ex",2

When I got my burger and fries, they were cold. The cheese I had asked for on it wasn't on it and my shake was too thin.   I really wanted this place to be good, because at least once a month while working in the loop I really want some red meat and to be honest, the concept of this place DOES make me feel like it's ok to eat red meat once a month.

"Two things you should know about Jaffa Bagels: 1, it's kind of hard to find.  If you stand on Michigan Avenue, you will not be able to see it.  Even if you walk into the lobby of the building numbered 225/205 Michigan Avenue, you will not be able to see it.  Only if you ascend the escalator, turn left, and start walking down a hallway past the Starbucks will you see it.  Which brings us to . . . . 2, it doesn't open until 11 a.m.  I understand that in Chicago, bagel beggars can't be choosers, but aren't there many people who consume bagels for breakfast?  I really would have thought so.  Luckily, the Dunkin' Donuts down the hall was open, so we went there.",2

However, be prepared to be waiting; waiting to be seated, waiting to be served, waiting for food. On a Saturday summer afternoon, the place was busy and the temperature was warm. The air was not very refreshing coming from the humid outdoor weather (and coming from Las Vegas where every store has sub-zero temperatures, this was not a good start). Although the wait was told at 35 minutes, is probably only took them 15 minutes to seat. When seated, however it did take another 5-8 minutes for a server to come over.

For a effing awesome, sunny side up burger, check it out at IHOP. It's pretty bangin' and half the cost of a Epic burger.

We all had a slice and it was more than one can handle. The crust was thick, the sauce was lacking flavor, and the stuffed cheese overpowered the entire pizza. I couldn't taste the crust or toppings over the cheese. And we were all very unpleased. Let me not be so harsh by saying, that it's not that bad where some may not enjoy. But my preference, I just don't like the stuffing of the pizza at all. And the pizza is pretty hard to reheat leftovers so the rest of",2

For the next 45 min-hour, your hunger grows while thinking of the awesome pizza you're about to stuff your face with. When they bring it out to you, the place it on the special pizza stands that all of the tables have, and serve you your first slice. My friend and I got the stuffed crust pizza with sausage.. while the sausage was really flavorful and REAL, there was just wayyy too much cheese and not enough sauce. I mean really, there was barely any sauce. It was like.... some bread, layers upon layers of cheese, and a spoonful of sauce on each slice. If you go here, avoid the stuffed crust!",2

Really? Calamari fritti was pretty good for an appetizer.  I had wild mushroom ravioli for an entree.  I LOVE mushrooms and unfortunately, they did not use just the mushroom caps but also used the stems.  Wild mushroom stems are woody and not really good for eating.  So every few bites I'd get a hard, chewy piece and it really ruins the whole experience.

It was a little after 4pm and the place was pretty empty, which is fine with me since I was on my own. From the start the service was subpar. Pretty much didn't care about my presence. I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out. The dressing is very very watered down. I have never had a caesar taste like that. There really was no flavor ",2

I can't believe that I'm saying this but I think that I'm at the moment in life where you learn to just say no to grease pits or more like I'm saving my greasy indulgence for something that will more then satisfy the craving (like late night Mexican or a hotdog joint). It's places like this, is the reason Chicago is overweight. It has all the fatty foods you can eat, of which they are known best for their ribs and pizza but I cannot attest to them. It has the same feel and almost look as Miller's but with more light. Seats and tables are comfortable and they have a descent bar area.

"Oye vay. Where to start? High prices, small portions, and the sassy staff were all very disappointing. Yes, your burgers are fresh and tasty, but just not enough to make up for a less than mediocre restaurant. Sorry Johnny.",2
"I dont really like stuffed pizza, but having said that, I also dont really like giordano's. Theres a lot of food involved, but all that cheese overwhelms the other things and the crust is terrible. Its too soft and absolutely dull. It took forever to get my giant hunk of cheese and I was so hungry I probably would have even worse things to say about it under other circumstances. The service was terrible. When I started writing this review I put three stars, but as I remembered my experience here I took a star off. Plus one star because for gods sake, its pizza.",2
"Deep dish pizza was good as always (although it seems to be going downhill over the years), calamari is always excellent,  but the service was horrible and the facility itself was way too hot. Turned otherwise good food into a less than enjoyable meal.",2
"I was so so disappointed. The two stars are for the chips, salsa, and guacamole that came with my wrap. They were plentiful and the salsa and guac were obviosly made fresh in house. But my wrap was such a let down. I ordered the Vail which is turkey with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and bbq sauce in a flour tortilla served hot. I watched the person assemble the whole thing and chuck it in the microwave. I could not believe it. Who in their right mind microwaves lettuce? The wrap came out limp and steamy all the way through. Avocado was soupy and hot, I removed the lettuce because it was slimy and practically liquified, and bbq sauce tasted thin and wimpy.  It was a complete wreck. Lunch buddy had a the turkey reuben and I got to try a bite. It was a perfectly acceptable sanwich, but nothing s",2
"Went to Gioco this past weekend with LK on our 'date night' before seeing the movie 'Date Night' and while we were not mistaken for another couple and subject to the capers that ensue in the movie we may have been better off skipping the night out and renting something on DVD. First off the place is pretty cool inside. Kind of a two tiered layout with a hip vintage feel to it. Bottles of wine all over the room and a neat open kitchen that makes you feel like part of the action but also makes sitting too close to the kitchen a little warmer than I find comfortable. Our server was fantastic - but I can't think of his name. He had some great input on our wine selection and his descriptions of the menu were very helpful. We started off with the mussels appetizer as per the recommendation of ma",2
"Gross.  When we first walked in, i felt that we may be in a chain type of place, but being from Philadelphia, i couldn't be sure. We ordered a small special and were fine with waiting the 40 minutes for it to be cooked (this is totally understandable) but like Hitarho said, it wasn't the size of the pizza that made me stop after one slice, it was the taste. totally bland and not even hot. I love my sauce too, and this just didn't do it for me. i felt like I had been robbed of my chicago deep dish experience.",2
"Overrated. A good idea, but not done that well. The juices are packed full of sugar, and the breakfast wraps are not all that. Beautiful little cafe outside, but sadly . . . wayyy too much sugar for me.",2
"Tsk tsk. Sad. A prime South Loop location, but a boring, and overpriced restaurant. This chain of places owned and created by the same person, all kind of look the same - like the Cheesecake Factory trying to be romantic and intimate. While I enjoyed my food at Marche, this is unfortunately not the case at Gioco. I had the Pesce Bianco. A whitefish on a bed of brocollini with inedible leaves, partially cooked fava beans, and little to no flavor. After spitting some leaves out, I ate more of my whitefish, which wasn't terrible, though the poor accompaniments were not helpful. The description of the dish sounds hopeful, but the taste is failure. I was not a fan of Gioco.",2
"Yikes, I thought Miller's was bad. I can't believe that I'm saying this but I think that I'm at the moment in life where you learn to just say no to grease pits or more like I'm saving my greasy indulgence for something that will more then satisfy the craving (like late night Mexican or a hotdog joint). It's places like this, is the reason Chicago is overweight. It has all the fatty foods you can eat, of which they are known best for their ribs and pizza but I cannot attest to them. It has the same feel and almost look as Miller's but with more light. Seats and tables are comfortable and they have a descent bar area. The staff is friendly and hospitable, I just try not to eat at these places if I can avoid it or afford it (yep, downtown prices).",2

I do have to say that the bun was great--perfectly steamed and not mushy or hard.  Good job. Fries here are not great.  Cheese that goes on top is gross.   Pay for a cab and go to Portillos.",2

"A very average breakfast experience here. The breakfast menu is pretty limited and the entrees were nothing to rave about about. I had the two eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs had too much pepper on them. Wouldn't you let the customer handle if they want salt/pepper on their eggs? The hash browns were greasy. It took quite a long time for us to get our entrees although the place was not crowded. With Wildberry so close, I can't imagine coming back here anytime soon. I hope the lunch menu is better than their breakfast!",2
"I'm still trying to figure out why you took the Whitefish sandwhich off the menu. Why did you do this?? I can't explain how good it was unless I go back and look at my monthly credit card statements because I probably ordered it once a week for months until it was off the menu. Don't expect too much from this place- the food is standard pub fare w/o that Whitefish sandwhich to choose from, the beer is slightly overpriced (but that's not the end of the world). Bears games, though, are pretty good and I do enjoy the brunch and have been there for ESPN1000 (Mongo and Coppock) broadcasts. And the staff is pretty friendly- have never had a bad time. So the review is mostly for the food.",2
"Yikes. This is the awkward review where we share we don't care for Chicago-style pizza. We went to Giordano's after an okay experience at Lou Malnati's a year or two ago.  I figured we ordered wrong (we built some crazy pizza) so thought we'd go traditional at Giordano's and see what all the hype is about. We started with the antipasto salad which was good, kinda a pain to eat with entire slices of cold cuts lying across the top of the salad, but once cut up was pretty good.  The little one wanted the mozzerella sticks, so we ordered those too - nothing special - just like ones you'd get at a bowling alley. We ordered the pizza and went traditional with sausage, pepperoni and mushroom.  First bit was interesting really cheesy and the toppings were tasty.  A few more bites and it was like a",2

Great 'Jimmy Salad' waffle Fries are always fun (albeit a bit overly salted) and the mini burgers are on par for other places. Nice decor. Lots of TVs.  REALLY great beer selection. But if you sit at the bar you really want to be sure Chris*** is not server. She has many very important text messages to deal with,  another server to chat with, schedules to go over with Mgr/ owner(?) This leaves no time to even ask me about a 2nd beer or remind me about the wings special promoted on the sign out front.  How much should I expect really, at 1:30 on a Wednesday, I only make up about 100% of her clientele.   Nice addition to the South Loop.  Has much going for it.  I'd bet this place is great fun on game n",2
"As a bar, I would add a star or two, but I'm reviewing the dining experience I had recently.  A group of about 15 people on a Tuesday, no problem with reservation, got right in. Let me start by saying the service was great.  Delightful server, very prompt, perfect attention level.  She even split the checks with a smile, which is a royal pain. The food, however, didn't impress.  Menu had variety, but it was a pub so fish and chips was the obvious choice for me.  Wish I hadn't.  The portion size was enormous (that's a good thing) but after a bite or two that didn't matter as much.  It's not that it tasted BAD, it's more like it didn't taste like much of anything.  Blah, no flavor, didn't excite me in any way.  Others said similar things, it was decidedly so-so I guess. I'd give it 2.5 stars",2
"First time in Chicago and I wanted the full experience so I figured my first meal would be a deep dish pizza. I head over to Giordano's because it is just around the corner from my hotel. It was a little after 4pm and the place was pretty empty, which is fine with me since I was on my own. From the start the service was subpar. Pretty much didn't care about my presence. I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out. The dressing is very very watered down. I have never had a caesar taste like that. There really was no flavor ",2
"Epic?  Wow ... they got some cojones to call themselves EPIC. When you talk 'Burger' the first & most important part of the equation is the beef patty itself.  The rest should be a tasteful accompaniment to the 'main attraction'. Unfortunately, in Epic Burger's case ... the bun, the cheese, the bacon, etc etc ... outshine the thin, well done, somewhat greasy beef patty.  'All natural' doesn't mean good.  Granted, it's an attractive Catch Phrase these days, but if you're proud enough to boast 'All natural' & 'Organic' ... I expect flavors other than I can get at any random diner in Chicago. Also - to sell what basically comes down to a slightly larger Steak & Shake patty on a fancy bun, with decent fries (a little too salty though) & a fountain drink for $9 (Cheese is extra mind you) ... is",2

"The only thing epic about epic burger is the hole it leaves in your wallet. I don't mind paying for good food. I don't mind paying for GOOD food. Why does my burger come out looking like someone ran it through the dish washer? Why is my bread not dry and fresh? Why do my vegetables look like they were sitting in a pool of their own sweat for hours? And why do my fries look like they someone just insulted their mothers and they can't do a thing about it? Poor sad dejected things. Now the taste is ok. It's not terrible. But what leaves me angry is that it could be so much better. With just a bit more care taken to put the food together you can have a wonderful burger. Especially with the ingredients that they use. For a place with food that isn't really epic, the service can make up for it. ",2

Well needless to say im really surprised about all the positive reviews, to begin the crust on the pizza was soo 'crackery' by that i mean pretty much it was alot like eating a thick saltine cracker it would break apart easily i think most-likely has to do with the dough they use to make it. Next the pizza itself had very little to almost no sauce and a mountain of cheese... I mean don't get me wrong i love cheese but this portion was enough to elevate ones cholesterol sky high, needless to say i really like there decor and all however i don't understand why they make there customers wait almost half an hour for some reheated pizza?

"My first sample of authentic Chicago deep-dish pizza in years, and I thought it was ok, but found out a couple days later in our pizza taste-test that there are other better places - namely Gino's East. The calamari and antipasto appetizers were decent. Nothing phenomenal but they were served promptly, which helped tide us over while waiting the typical 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. We got their 'special' (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers) but I felt like it was essentially a big, thick cheese pizza with a few good chunks of sausage.  But mostly you just get a big mouthful of cheese.  I agree with other reviews, that the crust is rather raw and doughy-tasting, which I really noticed and brought the pizza down a notch.

The crust was quite lacking in crispness and flavor, sort of a bland wheat crust that merely held everything together.

The selection of British beer is impressive and there are 8+ selections on draft.  The food is standard pub fare.  Unfortunately, the kitchen did not have a few of our first-choice appetizers due to the holiday.  Through process of elimination, we settled on potato skins, bruschetta, and onion rings.  Lots of deep fried options. My favorite: The onion rings.  Not too greasy or soggy. My least favorite: The bruscetta.  It was like a cracker with some chopped up tomato thrown on top. A few hours l",2

They told me they were, but a few minutes later, after I ordered a deep dish pizza, the waitress told me they had 'turned the oven off' and therefore they couldn't make me a pizza (who knows f that is true? About 10 minutes after that they served a pizza to another table, so maybe they just didn't want to wait for the pizza to bake). The waitress was also not very attentive and took about 15 minutes to bring the drinks we ordered...

However, be prepared to be waiting; waiting to be seated, waiting to be served, waiting for food. On a Saturday summer afternoon, the place was busy and the temperature was warm. The air was not very refreshing coming from the humid outdoor weather (and coming from Las Vegas where every store has sub-zero temperatures, this was not a good start). Although the wait was told at 35 minutes, is probably only took them 15 minutes to seat. When seated, however it did take another 5-8 minutes for a server to come over.

Meh: Gluten free, vegan banana walnut choc chip bread.  Pricey for $6.50! Burger.  Not great, but not bad.  Hits the spot if you're hungry. BLEH!: Green eggs and ham.  This dish was super acidic and not satisfying at all.  My suggestions: more fatty meat is needed to cut through the acid, remove the onions, and serve with biscuit/toast to soak up the juices and grits. Convenient location for those",3

We were expecting more from here because of the reviews and I am not sure if that was due to the items we chose or not, but maybe we'll come back and give this another try.

Really??  I'll probably still go back for some lunch though.... Over to my trusty Yolk we went for a fabulous breakfast at half the price!",3

"This is my second visit to this place, and what a difference from lunch to dinner. Lunch, I was seated right away. Dinner, I waited nearly 45 minutes after being told it would be 20. I watched people come and after a 5-10 minute wait they were seated. They kept trying to get me to go to the bar, they only had had high tables and I need my feet to be on the ground, not hanging or clinging to the chair rails. When I got to my table, I mentioned the wait to the server and suggested the manager buy me a beer. That's what happened and it made all the difference! The pizza arrived within 3 minutes of my sitting down. It wasn't really hot, but just fine for me. It was loud and hot inside and I had to listen to 2 tables of idiots on either side of me, but that's not their fault. I didn't mention t",2

"The meal started off well... Gioco was able to fit my friend and I in for a quick dinner (our original choice of Eleven City Diner was closed for a private party) before we saw Mama Mia at the Roosevelt Theater. By the way, it's here for another week and SO good!! You'll have 'dancing queen' stuck in your head for weeks- fun times. My friend and I decided we'd split an appetizer, but between my allergies and weight watchers diet and her pregnancy diet there wasn't much on the menu for us to split.  We finally decided on the fried calamari, which isn't so weight watchers friendly, but my friend is pregnant with twins so I figured I was up against 3.  My friend may be eating for 3, but I did quite a good job of polishing off that delicious fried calamari with her. As for the main meal I deci",3
"This would be a meh, but their food is good - especially their ale pie, which is the best I've tasted outside Ireland - so they get an extra star. Just as noisy and crowded as every other restaurant in the Loop. Just as pricey, too. The waitstaff is super friendly, almost to a fault, but considering how busy they get, you should probably be grateful it's one extreme and not the other. If you go: it's crowded and you will very likely have to wait. The Guinness is pretty decent. The calamari is tender and served with a yummy, yummy sauce. The fish and chips were meh, and the rum raisin cake was disappointing.",2
"I really wanted to like this place. With its hip young crowd and giant dining space, I really like the decor and the ambience it has going. Even though I couldn't read a single thing on their pricey computer screen, it definitely drew my attention. Sadly, I found the food to just be quite average. I ordered the epic burger combo with a four berry smoothie, and I was waiting to experience the epicness. Unfortunately, the burger was a little dry for my taste, and I had to add a lot more ketchup than a good burger should require. The sauce wasn't extraordinary, but did remind me of the goodness that is In-n-Out back home. That also reminded me that I could've gotten the same amount of food there for half the price. I was a huge fan of their fries, but the smoothie was also just average. Maybe",2

"It's hard to check off your must-do's in a city like Chi-town when you've only got 2 days to do it ... we had to be efficient with our time. As it happened, Giordano's was only a few blocks away from The Hard Rock Hotel where we were staying. 'Try Deep Dish Chicago-style pizza' - CHECK!!! I was astounded at how packed this place was when we got there. Luckily, shortly after putting our name down on the wait list (and subsequently ordering our pie - which they recommend to people who are on the wait list), two seats opened up a the bar. My first recommendation is to NOT go to Giordano's if you're starving ... we waited approximately 40 minutes for our pizza, and it was a small pie. Don't let the size fool you, though. As a NYer, I'm used to thin crust pizza. This pizza's deep dish is compri",3

"Eh.  It wasn't awful, but the way they hype up their burgers, they're very forgettable.  Waitress screwed up my drink order about three times, and it was just beers.  It wasn't too far off, as she'd get the family of brands right, such as Sam Adams, but if I asked for a Noble Pils, a Boston Lager would return.  It really didn't bother me too much and became a kind of fun game of what she would return with.  If I lived nearby, I could see myself going here as my local, but since I'm a few miles away, I likely won't return.",3
"Well, what do you know?  The second meal here would be deep dish once again!  Can't get enough of it, I guess? This place has quite a different feel from Gino's.  It was more brightly lit and there was no graffiti.  There was plenty of seating, so we were at our table right away. I think I was more hungry, so I felt prepared to finish the pizza this time around.  We ordered a small instead because we learned our lesson the night before.  Sausage topping again.  Don't know why.  I guess we wanted to try crumbled.  We also ordered garlic bread to help with the wait.  The bread was not bad, the sauce was okay.  It wasn't as good as Gino's sauce.  The pizza actually came a little quicker this time.  The pizza was slightly different from Gino's.  I think it's more cheesy, which I wouldn't consi",3
"Started with the chop salad, which was fine. Then had the sausage, pepper, mushroom deep dish pizza. It was just so-so. I expected it to be more flavorful (it's VERY rare for me to say a restaurant serves food that isn't flavorful enough, usually it's the opposite problem). With so many other deep dish pizza options in Chicago, I'd definitely try another place first before coming here.",3
"Classic Chicago experience.  There will be a line and you will most likely have to wait, but it is a memorable experience.",3

"Meh. This place seems to get mixed reviews...so here's mine! We ordered a deep dish and I was expecting much better for all the hype this place has! Nothing really stood out about this pizza: sauce was ok, cheese was ok, toppings (well, fillings) were ok too. It was just ok. It got the job done, we walked out full but I definitely didn't have the 'WOOO, I just had the bestest Chicago-style deep dish pizza evAr' feeling that I was hoping to get. Not going to be telling my friends to check this place out, but hey, I guess I've tried real deep dish now.",3

"I've been eating Jersey Mike's subs since 1995 when they entered Ohio.  The subs are hands down the best subs I've ever had.  If I had to rate the place solely on food they would certainly get five stars.  The Italian sub is to die.  If you are watching calories, they also have the option of making any sub into a wrap.  The toppings are always fresh and high quality.  Get it 'Mikes Way' - you can't go wrong. As to why they get three stars.....I don't like the set up of this location, or how they handle your order.  They get very busy at lunch and literally create the sandwiches like a bat out of hell.  Your sandwich gets handled by several people throughout the assembly line process and the way they flop the sandwiches around down the line reduces my hunger. I'm sure if they were any slowe",3
"This place gets fairly busy for lunch, but they usually have open tables. One beef that I have with the place is that they don't take reservations or seat you until your party is there in full. We had a lunch meeting and were waiting for the whole party, but wanted to order some appetizers, but they wouldn't seat us. Once our full party arrived we were finally seated, but chose not to get appetizers (lost revenue for Elephant!). The food was surprisingly good and the service was adequate. I wouldn't say we got the best service in the world as our drinks were empty during half of our meal, but then again the server took the drinks off our bill! It's worth a try if you're in the area and looking for a pub with good food.",3
"We went to Elephant & Castle today for a St. Patrick's Day lunch (yes, it is technically English but Emerald Loop was packed) and had a great time. Many of us had either the Corned Beef & Cabbage dinner or Corned Beer sandwich and all seemed to enjoy our meals. The high note of the lunch was when I saw that my favorite beer from Ireland (Kilkenny) was now being sold in the US. I could have left lunch at that point and been a happy camper. I would recommend E&C for a lunch time or post-work drink in the Mag Mile/Loop area.",3

"This is a typical downtown pub.  I work across the street so I pay this place a visit for lunch at least once a month. I usually come here with my coworker, who gets the fried chicken finger and fries appetizer every single frikken time.  I must admit that they are pretty good though.  Approximately 5 to 6 big chunks of chicken tenders that has the right amount of crisp to them yet are still moist in the center and fries with ranch and honey mustard sauce is pretty good, albeit pricey. That is what you get for being in downtown I guess. I tend to go all over the menu so I've had their burgers, pizza, salads and specials... All good but their burgers are the standout.  It's thick burger grilled to order.  I've gotten the regular burger medium to medium rare and added on the mozzarella chees",4

"My colleagues and I set out for Giordano's on a beautiful sunny day last August. We got there just before the lunch crowd hit, so we had no problem securing a table. We wanted a fresh pie, but were told the wait was about half an hour, so we opted for individual deep dish pizzas, which were already prepared. This turned out to be smart choice since I only made it through 3/4 of my personal pie. That is to say, it was quite filling and tasty too I might add. Service at this place wasn't anything to sing home about, but I guess you can't expect exceptional service at a pizza joint.",3

"I had their stuffed Yorkshire pudding and my friend had their fish and chips. The orders were huge and somewhat delicious. Surprisingly the mashed potato was really good. I was a little disappointed with the fish though. The fish 'chunks' are embarrassingly small but it was served with a lot of thick long fries. It seemed to me that they are cutting back on the cod/halibut and hope that the potatoes will fill the gap. Real British chips are thick and 'chipped', not long. The interior looks authentic but the atmosphere is no where near the pubs that I have been in England. Service is not bad. Disappointedly, they don't sell Britain's best selling Carling beer.",3

There's a reason that pizza and ribs are on the marquee -- get them.  Deep dish is above average, but stay away from the barbecue pizza (I like barbecue, but it just tasted off somehow).  If you like your deep dish cheesy, this is the place for you.  The burgers here are pretty good too, and cooked to order.  Other than that, I'd write off the rest of the menu.  It's not bad, but you'd do better somewhere else.

"Deep-dish Pizza is what you get when you have Irish immigrants try their hands at making pizza.  It is the bastard child of a savory pie traditional of the Irish, British, and Scots with the flavor and ingredients of Italy. Deep-dish pizza flirts with its identity and pushes the definition of what is pizza to its absolute limits and is by far the most unique of all the styles of pizza one commonly finds. Even the crust is more like pie crust in texture and flavor then anything remotely like any other pizza you've had. It so happens that the crust is absolutely the best part of Giordano's pie. Sadly, the sauce is dense, sweet, and more reminiscent than I'd like to canned tomato paste. The cheese and toppings are fairly average. The whole experience is also pleasantly less greasy than one wo",3

Other falafel sandwiches have tried and come up short- falafels too gritty, wrong/goopy combination of toppings, too far away from the office, etc.   I've passed by this place many times on my quest (it's easy to miss- downstairs with the Roma Pizza and Dunkin Donuts), although today was the first time that our paths crossed.  I asked the Oracle if this falafel sandwich might be the one (read: I ate it).  The answer: this is not the one.  However, with the right amount of training (use a thicker pita that does not fall a",3

Potato skins, pretty good, but overpriced like everything else on their menu. Service, not so great either.  We had Robert who seemed pissed off at us from the start.  Not sure why, maybe cuz one of our friends asked if he could just start with a water, but that was before he ordered an app and the $12 mac n cheese!  He also was slow as hell, he",3

We started with a heart-of-palm salad, which was actually really a good salad. But we ordered it split, and even the split portions were honestly too big for one person.  There is such a thing as too much of a good thing.

I got the traditional cheese pizza and the signature pizza with the sausage and onions.  Very flavorful - generous toppings, good quality cheese, and the crust was decent. 2.

The place has an awesome 40s vibe throughout the whole restaurant. The service was good and the food came fast. Not going to lie it came out to 27 dollars for one sandwich, a mimosa and a coke. Yes, kinda pricey, but you will have enough for left overs.",3

My breakfast items were good and his sandwich was good. Great atmosphere though, and the candy counter is tempting! We were expecting more from here because of the reviews and I am not sure if that was due to the items we chose or not, but maybe we'll come back and give this another try. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't rave-worthy. We'd come here again if we were in the mood for something easy and not too fancy.",3

If you compare it to Zachary's in Oakland its mediocre at best. Maybe we had a bad pie but I don't think so..pretty bland, except the sausage, that was the pizza saver. But literally the only true flavor was in the sausage. Next time I'll go for Gino's East.",3
"Hit or miss for me.  I went for lunch during the week - naturally crowded and tried the curry.  Not good at all - way too little flavor and too much liquid for the rice (or not enough rice).  Went again for lunch on a weekend (so much better without the crowd) and tried one of the sandwiches with much better success.  My friend had the mashed potatoes and they were real - not instant, which is a plus.  Service was great both times and the atmosphere is nice - not many sit-down places in this price range over on this side of the loop.",3

I recommend the fries without ever having had them because odds are a pub does fries well, not the case with the soup. I'd go back for drinks, but probably not exclusively for the food.",3
"Eh.  It wasn't awful, but the way they hype up their burgers, they're very forgettable.  Waitress screwed up my drink order about three times, and it was just beers.  It wasn't too far off, as she'd get the family of brands right, such as Sam Adams, but if I asked for a Noble Pils, a Boston Lager would return.  It really didn't bother me too much and became a kind of fun game of what she would return with.  If I lived nearby, I could see myself going here as my local, but since I'm a few miles away, I likely won't return.",3
"Pretty good food. Super slow service. I felt bad for our server/bartender. We sat at the bar to avoid the hour or so wait to get seated. Wasn't the greatest choice as those trying to get a drink like to shove in all around you. There was only one bartender for a busy night whom also has to attend to the servers requests. They REALLY need someone additional there. It was terribly hard to get a drink. He forgot my Diet Pepsi the first go round. 20 min. later re-asked for it and all was well with the world. Salads - good stuff. Enough for 2 people at the very least. Chicago style pizza....also very good. The crust was so-so, but all the gooey cheese and toppings were great. Good decent food overall.",2
"If I had a small child I would sell it for deep dish pizza. Ok I'm exagerrating, but I love love love deep dish pizza and live in the Northeast where they cling to their love of New York style pizza. So I'm in Chicago for Lollapallooza and what am I going to do?? Stuff myself silly with the best deep dish in the world..   Unfortunately Giordano's did not deliver. The pizza was good, but the crust wasn't nearly as crispy as deep dish places in San Francisco (of all places) and the toppings seemed a bit soggy. I would certainly come back here but Chicago must have better...",3
"The deep dish pizza was great! As other people have said it does take about 35-40mins for pizza to arrive, but I found this tone a great time to sit and converse with friends!Will be going back again.",4
"this jamba juice is great. the staff there are so much fun i don't mind waiting for my smoothie if it's busy. and when it's not busy that smoothie is in my hand before i can say smoothie.",5
"No frills just great pizza.  Not a huge fan of stuffed so I usually get the thin crust.  Its good and I would recommend it to anyone.",4
"After 4 years of eating Chicago pizza, Giordano's is still my favorite.  There's just something about the crust that makes me prefer it to the competitors.  And I like going in and getting their individual specials for $6 - great deal!",5
"I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but ultimately settled on 4 because I don't have much to compare my deep dish to.  The last time I had Chicago deep dish was about 10+ years ago.  Anyway.... We showed up a little after 6 on a Sunday evening Labor Day weekend.  Busy.  45 minute wait for 2 people.  But we spied 2 spots at the bar and took those instead of waiting for a table.  Best decision ever. The bartender was AMAZING.  He was so fun to watch, quick to respond to drink requests and so accommodating to the table drink orders as well as those of people waiting for tables.  He was one of the highlights of the meal, seriously. The pizza was delicious.  We got the SMALL special stuffed, it was MORE than enough for my boyfriend and I, and we took home 2 slices for leftovers.  As I continue to ",4
"Was in town and my cousin insisted we go to Giordanos if we wanted real Chicago pizza. I'm so glad we went. We were starving when we got there after walking several country miles around town. We ordered the combination appetizer - mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini sticks and fried mushrooms - you can see the theme here breaded and deep-fried, all good, served with marinara sauce and ranch. Mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were my favorite the zucchini was a bit mushy, but still ok. We decided to 'the special' deep-dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onion and green pepper. We added spinach on one half and pepperoni on the other half. With a pizza this thick it took 40 minutes to bake but the results are divine and our waitress warned us ahead of time. The cheese is ooey-gooey, stringy delic",4
"I saw these popcorn shops all over, and being a tourist looking to grab something to bring home to the folks, I stopped off here right before heading to the airport. Word of advice: they sell this popcorn even at the airport. Popcorn is buttery, heart-stopping and delicious. Real salt, real butter and sugar make an fantastic mix in this ultra-snack. Only that it's so fresh that it doesn't last more than a day before it goes stale. Also, the price is a bit exorbitant. But all that butter does have a price.",5
"From one Jew to another, this is an awesome diner experience. Had a little bit of breakfast and a little bit of lunch for our dinner last time, plus a chocolate shake to top it off. The chocolate malt was the best I've had in the city, no joke. It's refreshing to have something that doesn't come out of machine once in a while. Mac N Cheese (with ham) is the bomb. The challah bread (pronounced 'Holla!' by our entertaining server) was the perfect side to the scramble we had as well. Service is great and the owner Brad is a solid guy who really cares that his patrons are taken care of, start to finish.",4
"Really awesome sandwich shop thats a cut above the typical chains like Jimmy Johns, Subway, etc. I've mostly gotten a warp so far and they have all been satisfying and not lacking in the flavor department. I love that all the wraps and sandwiches come with chips and guacamole, can you say win?! Plus most sandwiches come with avocado as a standard ingredient, not something you have to pay extra for (I'm looking at you Subway!). Great place to go for a sandwich during lunch but beware of the line this place can build up.",5
"I am totally in love with the turkey burger from here, it is the best I ever had. I have to stop myself from going in here everday when I have school. All the ingredients are fresh and organic and it taste so delicious its addicting! I have had the fries a few times, which are good as well, but the price of the burger alone is expensive, sometime they give a student discount so be sure to ask if you have your id on you!",4
"Total dive bar and hole in the wall type of joint. I love it. Great jukebox, great parking late night, and you can always get something to go late night. Atmosphere isn't great at all....But that's not the purpose of this place.",4
"I had some time to kill while i was waiting for my room in the Hyatt to be prepared, so I decided to go next door and get some of this 'world famous' pizza I've always heard about.  Well the deep dish lived up to the slice.  I got the sausage, pepperoni, and jalapeno stuffed deep dish, and it was incredible.  Just a word of caution, give yourself some time to order and eat because it takes about 35-45 mins to make each one. While I was waiting I had some local beers on tap and they were excellent.  My bartender Marcee was the best.  She kept me company and my glass full the entire time i was there...which ended up being around 3 hours. Hey what can I say, once the drinks start flowing right...lol.   When you go to Chicago, you should definitely give this a shoot, you won't be disappointed.",4
"Okay, if you are looking for a place that serves up hearty sandwiches and wraps, then look no further. Goodwin's is the place to go.  It kind of reminds me of a New York Deli -- the sandwiches are big and the place is always packed.   My favorites sandwiches are the durango and the brighton (there are about 15 to choose from).  The durango is the grilled chicken with avocado and provolone cheese and the brighton is a turkey with a layer of cranberry sauce and cream cheese on multi-grain bread.  I've also tried the Manhattan clam chowder, which had a fresh bold flavor. Be warned...this place is always busy.  If you are in the rush, phone in your order and pick it up.",4
"The people were super friendly, the ambiance was very vibrant and alive and I felt comfortable just chillin eating my Philly style fries.  The wall deco theme was pretty rad and my peanut butter smoothie creation left a fabulous thumbs up from my tummy!",5
"Tried the Orange-A-Peel, it was o-k. Not too sweet, but kind of lacked flavor, in my opinion. Still love the Pomegranate-Pick-Me-Up, its tangy with little sweetness had it a few times again. Still love my new discovery of the world of Jamba Juice!",4
"Great.  This deep dish has the best crust, in my opinion of 'the big three' (Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's) - it is flaky in a good way, and adds just a bit of crunch to the otherwise gooey and squishy pizza. The sauce is sauce, not puree (like Gino's East) or stewed chunks (like Lou's), but has good flavor and just a bit of acidic bite.  The famous upper-crust is there if you look, but honestly, I don't taste or feel it when I eat it, and if I didn't look for it, I'd never know it was there.  The cheese, of course, is excellent as well.  This is perhaps the thickest slice of the big three deep dish pies. On a negative note, this location is stingy with toppings.  My recent visit included both Italian sausage on one pie and pepperoni on another.  There were, sadly, perhaps two",4
"My friends that have been to Chicago insisted that I visited this place during my short stay in the windy city. After trying their recommendations of the caramel and cheddar popcorn I understood why. De-licious!!! WARNING: DO NOT EAT IT THE NEXT DAY, IT WILL GO STALE AND YOU WILL BE SAD!",4
"Wow, you Chicagoans don't play around when it comes to making uber-thick pizza!  Six of us newbies showed up at Giordano's and ordered three medium deep-dishes and appetizers.  We were famished so we figured half a pizza each... Oy, the menu wasn't kidding when it said each pizza serves 3-4 people!  By the time we were done, we'd only finished half of what was on the table and our eyes were rolling into the backs of our heads.  I lost my deep-dish cherry to the spinach and special, and I'm still having foodgasms thinking about it.",4
"This place....is awesome. Me and my friends were looking around heading towards a certain restaurant that yelp said was good but when we passed by this restaurant, we saw how busy it was and decided to come on in and I'm so glad that I did. The waitress is just wonderful- she took all our orders, split our checks and answered ALL of our extensive questions about the food and just anything about Chicago. She was such a sweet woman and I thank her for making Chicago just that much friendlier. Okay, so I got the fish and chips that were decent, had buffalo wings as a app (amazing and very saucy), tried the 18 oz. burger, lamb chops, appetizer sampler, and their seasoned fries were AMAZING.  So amazing that we ordered a few more orders. The waitress recommended the pizza but we just had deep d",4
"I really like this place, for a hotel bar. Julio, the manager is the bomb and they have great beer and good food. Looking for a yummy beer? Try the Lagunitas (pronounced: 'LAH-GOO-KNEE-TUSS') Lil' Sumpin' Sumpin' Wheat Pale Ale.",4
"Went here with my wife and her parents.  I've heard and read mixed reviews about Gioco but was very happy to have some of the best italian food I've had in Chicago, even though I previously lived in Little Italy.  In my opinion this is a step above Rosebud and Tuscany and a few steps above Jay's on Taylor.  I had bison ragu, my wife had seafood risotto but most memorable was my mother-in-law's mushroom pizza.  All were good and I was very surprised by my ragu -- very rich and creamy taste.  The pizza was great, looking forward to getting one of these as takeout for a Millennium Park for a concert.",5
"This restaurant has good energy and great food.  The service, even  for a Saturday night, was kind of slow but since the food was so good and the people were friendly, we hardly cared.  The gnocchi and thin crust pizza were both delicious.",4
"While I'm not usually a fan of deep dish pizza, Giordano's was as good as I've heard about. Can't wait for my next trip to Chicago to try another variety!",4
"Some of these negative reviews makes me wonder if people just want to stand out from the crowd for their cool, useful, and funny points.  If I ever get invited to a Yelp event, I'll probably get beat up by these people. Giordanos was the first deep dish pizza place I ever had in Chicago, and it's still my go-to place whenever I'm in town.  First of all, it's pizza.  It's not orgasmic and it's not going to blow your taste buds like in those old Starburst commercials.  It's Chicago-style pizza, but not so doughy.  The actual crust portion is pretty thin, but it's stuffed with toppings and loaded with cheese.  I guess this is why Giordanos calls it stuffed pizza instead of deep dish pizza.  I recommend the Giordanos special which comes with onions, mushrooms, sausage, and some other stuff I c",5
"The location is easily missed and in an awkward basement setting, but besides that they have really tasty sandwiches and salads for a good price.  It is always packed at lunch time, but definitely worth the wait.  The food is really fresh and made right in front of you.",4
"Yummy! When you want a burger (or chicken sandwich) and fries, and like me, you've gone to Portillo's one too many times, this is the place! I got the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend tried the Junior burger. The whole-wheat bun was really tasty, as was my chicken sandwich. Of course we went for the combo, which included oily hand-cut fries (yum, obviously) and a drink. I asked for the pickles and Epic Sauce on the side, which had a nice zing to it. When I saw you could order a shake made with low-fat frozen yogurt and skim milk, I was sold - I tried the chocolate. Really good, thick, and so tasty I had to ask them if they made it with fro-yo, because it tasted like a true milk shake. I felt sick a few hours later for eating way too much, so I think I'll hold off on the fries and shake ne",4
"I was in Chicago back in July and went to Gino's East after hearing all about it for it's great deep dish pizza.  I was never a HUGE fan of deep dish pizza overall, but I did enjoy it at Gino's East, though not to the point where I would go out of my way to go back.  We stopped in at Exchequer last night and tried their deep dish pizza.  In short, I'll be back there every time I come to Chicago.  Not only was the pizza incredible enough to make me a bigger fan of the deep dish, but it was also very well-priced.  $13 to feed three of us - can't go wrong with that.  The people were also really friendly, as expected in Chicago.  I want to come back here and try the ribs, which is another thing this place is apparently well-known for.  I highly recommend trying this one out.",5
"$100 on dessert!!!!!!!!! I nearly passed out when i saw the bill : / Here's the story: On Saturday nights during the summer months, Navy Pier does a fireworks show at 10pm. So i had the bright idea of watching the fireworks display from a nice view, while sipping on some wine and enjoying some dessert. Well, i looked thru our hotel guide book and found that Everest (located at the top of the Chicago Stock Exchange) was a block away from us and according to some Yelp reviews has 'THE best view in the city'. 'Sweet!' - i thought So we're at the restaurant and i feel COMPLETELY under dressed!!! Patrons at the restaurant look like they stepped out of a Dynasty episode - in their gowns, finest jewels, tuxedos, and i'm in skinny jeans and a black sweater : P I'm completely uncomfortable at this ",4
"Winter's creeping up on us, but that hasn't deterred Jason's Deli from offering free soft-serve ice cream to dine-in guests. This location replaces an old, skanky Arby's and I think a crusty Sbarro Pizza location. You can tell that they're still working out the kinks as the young, nervous staff works hard to show you where to go and try to explain food options. If you've not experienced the pager system, be prepared to give your order and place a buzzer on your table, where the staff will bring you eats. Jason's offers an all you can eat salad bar for $7.59 and has a host of healthy options on the menu.  The manager's special is either half a sandwich and soup or a remix of that.  They don't use high fructose corn syrup, MSG or artificial dyes, but do use all natural ingredients and sport ",5
"Being a salaryman near the station, I often find myself wandering the food courts looking for a delicious lunch to eat. When I see this place, I think of chicken wings, however they dont serve them at this branch... so sad. Food is oily and good. Prices arent bad either..",4
"Been back to Eggy's a handful of times since opening day. Each time my boyfriend and I go, it seems they are out of something on the menu. Nevertheless, we've enjoyed our meals and continue to go back. For breakfast, we've tried the Green Eggs + Ham, the Garden Omelet, and the Benedict, all of which were tasty. However, I thought the Green Eggs + Ham was too mushy and needed some extra ingredient for texture. My boyfriend ended up eating that, and I ate his omelet. I really enjoyed the omelet, and I'm not even a big egg person. So far, my favorite breakfast item is still Peter and the Wolf. His is the Benedict. On our most recent visit, I had the Slow Roasted Pork Sandwich (essentially a Reuben), and my boyfriend had the Whitefish Sandwich. The pork Reuben was rich and tasty, but the bread",4
"Convenient location from the 'L' Red, Orange, or Green Line (south of the Loop to the Roosevelt stop; east to Wabash, then north one block to Eleven City Diner). I was in the area for a film festival at Film Row Cinema - Columbia College Chicago. I only had 45 minutes before the film started and I hadn't had dinner yet, so I stopped in at Eleven City Diner. I sat at the counter and ordered lentil soup and a salad. My server was very friendly and had a genuine smile. I told her I was in a hurry and she promptly brought me my salad and drink. Soup came shortly thereafter (piping hot!). I got my check right away, paid, and was on my way. Check for soup, salad, and drink was $10, not including tip. Food was good. Not as cheap as a greasy spoon diner. Service was great and accommodating.",4

"Great Pizza!  My first stop whenever I come to Chicago, which is several times a year, is straight to have some deep dish Chicago pizza.  Like all places, when ordering a deep dish, order immediately when seated.  The place is usually busy so ask for a menu while waiting.  When eating in the bar, like I did as I was flying solo, gives you more time to enjoy a couple drinks.  Wish they did the mini (personal) size at dinner.  I can do some damage on a pizza but still have some left on a small if trying to eat it all myself.  I'm from the southern California area and we ordered 3 pizzas with overnight shipping a few weeks later for my wife's birthday.  She's also a huge Chicago deep dish pizza fan.  Shipping makes it a little pricey but still tastes great.",4
"Please read Mike M.'s review below (2005)   This bar is located in the heart of the financial district which is why so many business people are here.  Weekdays if you are just getting off work and want to relax in a nicely decorated pub, drink an expensive beer, do come.  Food is excellent, moderately priced for the area. Alcohol is expensive, beers average $6-8 bucks, no 23ozs. Surprisingly shots weren't as expensive as I thought, $6-7 bucks, large shotglass. Bartenders were cluless about different shots I'd ordered, even when I'd given them the solutions, they still managed to screw it up. Waitstaff and bartenders are helpful and the atmosphere is fun. Nonsmokers be alert.",4
"Eleven City Diner is a very welcome addition to the South Loop neighborhood.  I can't get enough of the latke!  They are thick, crispy, and very flavorful.  The sandwiches are too big for my taste (especially the open-faced reuben), but I like that I can order a simple pastrami sandwich (on their very yummy challah bread) or a variety of breakfast fare- all day and late into the night.  Bring your hungry friends to enjoy this modern diner.",4
"I love the atmosphere in this place!!!  it's sooo.........euro.  =) also, I thought of Cheers when I was here.  very cute....think wood and stained glass. my lunch date got the meatloaf that came w/ red skin garlic mashed potatoes (very good!) and REAL green beans.  I got the castle club w/ the english chips (seasoned french fries).  Very good food and atmosphere, average service.  I will be returning!",4

"The good: Decent beer selection Specials Above average pub food (hence a little more expensive) The bartender has always been great. The bad: Sometimes it's ridiculously loud (just in the bar area, so who's REALLY complaining). There's no dedicated/noticeable host, so if you want to sit in the more secluded dining area in a back, it can be a confusing, 'where should I go' moment. WHY DID THEY TAKE THE GUINNESS CHEDDAR SOUP OFF THE MENU??????? We definitely enjoy this place as a go to, close to home, neighborhood pub.",4

"Grillers is cash only so my trip today was a treat considering I'm usually only a plastic purchaser. I had the veggie burger and onion rings. The onion rings are pretty standard, and certainly would have been better with tempura batter, but the veggie burger was very, very tasty. I got it with everything on it, mayo, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and ketchup, it was pretty perfect. The bun is large, making it look like this is the biggest burger you've ever had, and is fluffy, covered in ground sesame. Overall, this place seems great for its location. The only competition it faces right now is Subway, which gets old very fast. Grillers has a LARGE variety of choices so if they got a credit card machine, they'd really be bumpin.",4
"We frequent this little joint on our lunch hour occasinally and it's pretty good. Not bad not amazing just good chineese at a decent price. If your going to eat in be warned that it's pretty warm during hotter days. The sesame chicken is pretty tasty as well. Prices are decent and you get a good value for your money.",4
"I came to Goodwin's for lunch yesterday and I absolutely loved it.  I have heard awesome things about this place and I have been dying to check it out.  I hear it gets pretty crowded around lunch time so we came a little later than the usual noon rush and got there around 1.  We snagged a table and looked over the extensive menu.  We all got wraps because we wanted the chips/guac/salsa on the side!  All the wraps sounded delicious - pretty similar combinations but all different.  I went with the Santa Rosa wrap with chicken, guac, sour cream, black bean mix and cheese.  It was amazing - big portion and just tasty to the very last bite.  My friend enjoyed their wraps as well.  I honestly can't wait to go back... I can't wait to try other wraps on the menu!  Well done.",4
"Wandered in here after the Shamrock Shuffle. Everything was really quick, which is great. We were seated right away, our waitress was very engaging and fast, and it was very comfortable. Decor isn't anything special, but, it has a warm, feel to it with a lot of history. The food was alright. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Alfredo. It was pretty tasty but I've had better... and worse. One thing I loved however, was that the waitress left a shaker of Parmesan Cheese at the table. Little things like that make me happy.",4

"Goodwin's is a great place to grab a sandwich for lunch in the Loop. The ingredients are high-quality: Boar's Head meats, fresh avocado, and healthy side selections. It's a hidden gem below street level, and a stretch as an everyday meal, but a welcome departure from the everyday sandwich.",4
"I thought the service at this one was great!  The staff is really friendly and accomodating and they made my smoothies super fast!  The drinks ARE expensive and I would suggest getting the smallest size.. I got a medium strawberry and it made me so full and stuffed!",5
"Great Italian steak joint. The place is narrow but dinning rooms go far back so it looks tight when you walk in but there's room. Atmosphere for dinner is cozy and dark. I would recommend asking for a table away from exposed kitchen because it tends to get noisy and a bit warm from the grill but if you re like me and enjoy watching how it all works then its no problem. They have the best Pappardelle al Ragu Di Cinghiale, which is wide ribbon pasta with a wild boar sauce and pine nuts. Don't let the word boar scare you, this dish is great. The pasta is fresh and handmade and the sauce is not overbearing but it maybe a bit salty if you don't care for salt. Last time I went with some people that never have been there before and they all had great meals and good things to say. Also try the Cro",4
"I came here with a friend about 2 years ago and the place was magnificent!

"I  thought I would give Epic a try, I work just down the block.  A bunch of my co-workers and I checked it out.  I ordered a Portebello burger for $5.99.  Huge mushroom on a Delicious whole wheat bun, good Epic special sauce, normal burger fix ins and add Wisconsin cheddar for .89.  a bag of hand cut fries is $2 but is huge and can easily be shared.   I loved my burger, very tasty.  Fries were good too. All meats are naturally raised and they seemed to care about the environment (disposable silverware that was corn based and bio degradable ) but the recycling can was no where to be found..hmmm Over all my co-workers and I enjoyed our burgers and they were Epic in proportion.  I will go back and split a burger and fries!",4
"I can't say I'm a deep dish pizza connoisseur, but the pizza here sure was good. I was in Chicago for a conference, and asked every local I met what place they recommended for Chicago pizza.  Giordano's was mentioned as the place to go almost every time. We almost didn't have time to stop in and try Giordano's stuffed pizza before we left.  But on the morning we were going to go back home, I searched for the closest location to the hotel, and called in an order.  At 10:30 in the morning, the actual restaurant wasn't open yet, but they were able to take my order right then--a definite plus when it takes about 45 min. from order time to eating time.  They were also accommodating to make our medium pizza half 'special' (sausage, green bell peppers, onions, & mushroom) and half cheese since on",4
"I never knew about this place until my boyfriend asked me to meet him.  It's not too far from home so I was game.   Yes, this is a union bar mixed in with some 'ties'.  It is pretty lively mid-week to Friday.  I really appreciate how well I am treated by the bartenders.  They are always very pleasant and friendly to me.  In fact everyone has always been very  courteous and the guys offer up their seats. I never paid attention to what we were paying for my drinks, I just learned it is $10 a glass for cabernet.  I thought it was a bit much but hey, it's the city. I've never eaten here so I can't help there.  Overall I enjoy stopping in for a few and will continue to do so.  PS, their washrooms are very clean which is really important.",4
"I love that Giordano's is open so late but the service was pretty slow. I also don't get why we had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated when the place is huge and there were plenty of open tables. On to the food.. I'm still debating whether it was a mistake to get that artichoke dip because although it was totally mediocre and left me with less room for that MASSIVE deep dish pizza, it took sooo long to get the food that I absolutely needed something to munch on. Anyway, the pizza actually did have really good quality ingredients but there was SO much cheese. I love deep dish pizza but omg I'm talking several inches of cheese. I literally could have had a heart attack on the spot at this place. The crust was delicious though. Honestly I wanted to throw up after eating there but now I'm cravin",4
"It's just way to tempting to have this place at the corner where dozens of buses and trains go breezing by every day.  You will see many happy commuters munching away on their tasty, fresh popped corn.  You have to get the combo bag - butter, carmel and cheese all rolled into one.  How cool is that?!",4
"With a name like Elephant & Castle, I probably would not be too eager to go for drinks in a bar with such a name, but every time I walked by it was super crowded. At last, I finally went for an after work drink, and they had a good special on Tuesday.....$3 Honeyweiss. I definitely recommend the Chicken Picks (deep fried pieces of chicken), Pretzels (again, deep fried), and the Potato Wedges (boiled? nope, deep fried). They were all mighty tasty though! The service was excellent, and we had a seat right next to the window to watch all the people freezing their butts off in the cold, while we were nice and toasty with our drinks and assortments of fried goodies.",4

"I love real fruit smoothies...so this is the kind of place I would be all the time.  My big problem is that they just cost too much for my liking.  I would never become a regular customer on that alone.  I can't help but feel that $5 for a cup is just not worth it.   I came here a couple times cause they had a promotion for $1 oatmeal.  I tried all the flavors I believe (banana, blueberry, and apple cinnamon).  I think the best was the blueberry cause it mixed so well together.  I think the worst was the banana cause you couldn't really blend the two together.  I practically had to eat all the bananas to get to the oatmeal...whats the point in that? Of course the drinks I had tasted great, it is just the price tag that scares me off.",4
"I've been here several times in the past few years and have enjoyed every meal. Food quality is always very good and servers always checked with us regularly. Definitely one of the better restaurants in the neighborhood.",4
"I came here with 5 other girls and we had so much food left over. You need to try to pace yourself here cause the pizzas take about 45 mins to make so within that time, we had some beverages, shared some salads, and the fried appetizer plate. By the time 2 medium and 1 small deep dish pizza came out, most of us were kinda full. I tried to eat 2 pieces and didn't feel very good afterwards. We had at least half of the pizzas left over. Each of us ate about 1.5 pieces and then called it a day. The pizza was very good. I don't know it it was the best pizza I have ever had but it definitely was very tasty. We couldn't even think of dessert afterwards and I couldn't really breathe normally for a few hours after. The staff was all very nice, too.",5
"My dude and I found ourselves downtown and in need of brunch.  This place kept popping up so we decided that the Breakfast Gods had spoken and jumped in a cab.   I wish I could talk about the diversity of our meal, but we both had the corned beef and pastrami hash and eggs.  It was really, really good.  Frankly, far better than I thought it was going to be.  Plus, we had bagels and the house made chive cream cheese.  I kicked that breakfast's ass, for sure.  It didn't stand a chance. Our server was a little iffy which almost made me give this only 3 stars but the hash was really that good.  Also, we saw a waitress and one of the managers kissing and doing some mild groping, that was offputting.  Keep it professional, kids.  Grope on your own time, I'm trying to enjoy my hash here.",4
"I thought the first time I ate here I was going to go home and die because honestly? The decor reminded me of this place in Brooklyn that gave me food poisoning. Thankfully I am still alive. My waiter was cool, funny and brought me everything I wanted. Taco Salad was HUGE and my friends are obsessed the Chicken Fingers, which were also good.  Over all a nice place to get drunk and eat food.",4
"Yes the lines are ridiculous, yes it's crazy to mull the thought of paying $5 for a small popcorn. But that Chicago Mix with the combo of sweet caramel and salty cheddar popcorn is a damn fine combination. A friday ritual for yours truly.",5
"I've been to this location of Giordano's twice now and both times I went for lunch. I had the special with sausage, cheese, green peppers, mushrooms & spinach etc, which was great as usual.  We didn't have to wait at all to be seated, but the pizza took about 45minutes to come out. I was starving, but it hit the spot!",4
"Went here with my wife and her parents.  I've heard and read mixed reviews about Gioco but was very happy to have some of the best italian food I've had in Chicago, even though I previously lived in Little Italy.  In my opinion this is a step above Rosebud and Tuscany and a few steps above Jay's on Taylor.  I had bison ragu, my wife had seafood risotto but most memorable was my mother-in-law's mushroom pizza.  All were good and I was very surprised by my ragu -- very rich and creamy taste.  The pizza was great, looking forward to getting one of these as takeout for a Millennium Park for a concert.",5
"I know there is nothing 'special' about the Jimmy John's sandwiches, but they are always fresh and fast and that is a lot to ask for in the Loop.  I love this location because the people are really friendly and know what I am talking about when I say I want the 'California' (I am terrible about remembering the names of things)  I don't think $5 for a sandwich that I like is a lot of money - I am more put off by the crappy ones at WolfGang Puck's cafeteria at the Graham School that masquerade as 'gourmet' and are atrocious and cost $7.",5
"I really enjoyed the thin-crust pizza here, washing it down with a Newcastle Brown Ale.  The service can vary immensely, between overfriendly, rude, and just right.  The casual atmosphere is very inviting, as well as the price.  Maybe I'll try the Deep-Dish when I go back.",4

"From street view this establishment elicits an underwhelming impression.  The oversized letters and neon signs remind me of another installation of Jimmy John's.  It actually took a recommendation by a bartender in Cleveland, OH for me to give it a try.   The interior is a whole different experience - a glorious upscale hipster diner...er Jewish Deli.  Whatever you want to call it, the atmosphere and staff is pleasant and accomodating.  Although the food is somewhat traditional, the taste is anything but ordinary.  The Corned Beef and Pastrami Hash was as good as any I have had in this genre, but the Mexican Scramble is a dish good enough to get every time.  If you're a carrot cake fan, this is a 'perfect' rendition.   Would have given this 5 stars, but they need to add an extra server at ",4
"Fab place for after work drinks with coworkers or friends.  You definitely get your money's worth when it comes to the drinks- they are not for the feint of liver. I've been here for happy hour with friends and coworkers alike,  Staff is always friendly without being pushy, and the appetizers are quite nice also!  The artichoke dip is delicious. Will definitely be back here for drinks.",4
"I really want to give them 5-stars if it were just about the popcorn, but they're also a retail store. So, yes, to start, they're popcorn is GREAT! Blah, blah, blah.  You can read everyone else's review if you want more descriptions of salivation and salvation. The stores are all very small and have one singular purpose, to sell popcorn to the masses from morning 'til night.  Though the place smells fantastic inside and out, there is a strange icky feeling about it.  I guess it must be all the butter in the air and the cramped little retail space. It took us three attempts before we could finally get a bag to try.  Our friends told us we 'just couldn't' miss out, so it became a mission for us.  Expect long lines during the day, often outside the door.  One of the times, they ran out of pop",4

"I dont know much about the deep-dish but the pizza from this place was really good. Front desk from our hotel told us that its better to order and pick up, cause it gets pretty packed and crazy in there and so we did. The pizza was very fresh, ton of cheese and the dough was just so good. Cheesy garlic bread was ok.",4
"Welcome the Southloop... we have been missing a bar or your type around here for quite awhile. The have good food.. the beef is yummy. Beers are a plenty Servers are attentive and the atmosphere is nice (seems like westloop, but its in the southloop)! Awesome place to watch a game, as tv's are a plenty.",4
"It is a very controversial topic but I believe Giordano's has the best deep dish. They have an awesome crust and the best tomato sauce. I actually crave the deep dish often. The only down side is that, the rest of the things on the menu isn't very delicious or anything. Nothing spectacular but definitely try the pizza!",4
"My husband and I were visiting Chicago for the first time and were really looking to have some Chicago Style Pizza. We went to one place that our hotel recommended however, we ended up leaving after being there for 10mins. We went to Giordano's hoping their service was going to be better and that the pizza was going to be good. IT WAS!!! Our server was super sweet and everything was so good! We got Fried Zucchini as an appetizer- so good! and we had gotten 1/2 cheese, 1/2 Pepperoni Stuffed Pizza. It was all so wonderful. There were alot of people in the restaurant and there were alot of families and children. Everyone was happy. and we were full by the time we left! We had gotten a medium sized pizza- for the two of us...we each were stuffed on the app and 2 slices each and we now have a l",4
"Mike Sheperd runs this place;  amazingly well.   I love the Madison - Avocado and tomato slices, leaf lettuce, Monterey Jack cheese and mayo (or pesto mayo) on multi-grain or honey oat bread.  DEEEEELISH!     It's one of the few delis where a vegetarian can be assured their sandwich isn't being prepped alongside a roast beef on a cutting board with beefy juices.... they are awesome.   And everyone I work with loves their Pentwater Club.  They also do catering, and create the best brownies I've ever had, EVER.  Say hi to Mike too, he's got to be the friendliest proprietor I've ever run into;  a great local business to support.   Tell your employer to order their boxed lunches for your next meeting too!",5
"The food here is awesome. The drinks are awesome. The staff is awesome. Lunch is not too pricey considering it is the Loop and the portions are HUGE. They give you the option to split with some one at the table too whereas some places down there scoff at the idea. After work drinks or dinner is fun and fantastic. I love the staff. If you love a good martini ask Lucy for her Dirty - you will not be disappointed!",5
"Delicious!! We ordered 2 large deep dish pizzas: 1 combo, 1 pepperoni with pineapple, and 1 veggie. This was more than enough to feed 10 hungry girls! Each slice is so thick, it's like a meal in it of itself! I don't think deep dish is my favorite type of pizza but if I am craving some, I would definitely come back to Giordano's!",5
"Love love love. The 'old school' feeling when you are there is unbeatable.. they do have great service too. One day the manager was literally seating customers. That says alot. I do not, however, like the prices. I do think its a little bit steep.. HOWEVER... the food is better than regular diner-food. So... all in all... definitely worth going and grabbing a milkshake and burger :)",5
"This past July my cousin's and I were exploring downtown Chicago during a family reunion and haphazardly stumbled on this place when we noticed our stomachs starting to rumble =/ Needless to say, it was the perfect mid-afternoon snack. The intense summer heat, humidity, downtown bustle and line that formed outside the shop were no deterrence compared to the sweet and savory aromas we picked-up 3 blocks away! We ordered one 'mix' barrel and it was scrumptious! Unlike those holiday tin mixes you buy... (you know, the one's you stock up on during Christmas in case someone gives you a gift and you 'forgot' about them so you hand over a pre-wrapped/ready-tagged barrel of popcorn... haha)  Anyways, I'm getting off subject... Like I was saying, Garrett's mix is NOTHING like the tin-mixes you find",5
"Great food and service. Enjoyed the shrimp pasta with a side salad.I highly recommend this dish. At many restaurants the pasta is to starchy or the cream sauce over powers the rest of the dish. Giordanos creates the perfect balance. I've only been here once while on a business trip and would ensure to go back when in Chicago.",5
"The cheese deep-dish was the best slice of pizza I've had in probably a year. The service was absolutely perfect.",5
"Here's how my luck goes:  a few months back, was walking aimlessly on Wabash with hunger pangs that were going to lead to some serious damage being done at the next reasonable food joint I saw.  So I see India Grill and went on to have a pretty subpar experience. Little did I know, the spot next door, Eleven City Diner, is seriously beastly with their food and no one had passed me the memo. I see what kind of friends I have.... Nonetheless, the food at Eleven City is unbelievable.  I got the Sam Levy Chicken sandwich. It was spicy, like I like everything, juicy and I had a lot of fun dipping it in ketchup. Special shot out to the chollah bread it was served on!  The bartender, Jennifer, was also extremely nice and informative and recommended I have a chat with a Dead Guy (its a beer. Hadn'",5
"I came here for a bachelorette party. They were playing Two Door Cinema Club, Passion Pit and Band of Horses : ) mmmmmm. Thank you. Also the food was good and the service was too. The atmosphere was typical pub except cleaner which was nice. The prices were decent for the loop. They have a shotski : ) Pub in the loop? Yes. Go here.",5
"Until a few days ago, I had never been inside Garrett's.  It was one of those treats that I loved but always ate when someone brought it to work or a party.  However, I wanted to bring something to Thanksgiving and there wasn't a pie shop in site. When I went in to order, I knew that it would expensive but I had no idea of the price. I ordered a 2 gallon tin and realized that it was $55.  Wowser. After paying, I realized that I could get 2 gallons in bags for $26.  Since my family could care less about the tins, I was hoping that they would let me change my order.  Since there was hardly anyone in line, they did.  Thank you!",5
"Beyond their famous pizza, their sandwiches are great. Forget the corner sandwich store and order from Giordanos because their sandwich quality surpasses their pizza quality if you can believe it.",5
"Definitely the best popcorn in Chicago and the long lines prove it!  I'm not a popcorn eatter but its always a treat!",5
"Seems like Chicago has alot of winners. Bears, White Sox, and now popcorn champions, Garrett's. Their sweet n' salty combination is delicious. A tad greasy but made with freshness and awesomeness. A little warning..... STUFF IS ADDICTING. My sister and I ate a whole tin before we knew it! The best is when you eat them in the same grab. But, the caramel and cheese popcorns are excellent in their own right as well. Be prepared to wait tho, the line was almost out the door when I went around 8pm on a friday night.",5
"oh ma gaw! no one comes close!",5
"From the the first step in doors, until the last scrumptious bite of gooey mozzarella melts in your mouth, this experience is one to fulfill all of your senses, especially those found on your pallet.Just being in this Establishment makes you feel like you might be a little bit Italian, even if you have no idea what ciao means. The staff is polite and professional. The service is right on. The food is................well, the food is the best part. When I visited Giordano's, I had a purpose. Friends had roared about their Chicago style deep dish pizza. Of course, I had to try it for myself. I had never had deep dish pizza before, so this was a brand new experience. What?! Sauce goes on top of the pizza?Let me tell you, it may take an extra 10 to 15 minutes for the deep dish to arrive, but i",5
"Still the best darn pizza in Chicago. I visit every time I am in town. The deep dish is the way to go and make sure you pre-order by phone it will save you a 40 minute wait. Giordano's has done an excellent job of keeping the taste, service and quality as they have grown I first visited in the 80's and did the Rush street location almost weekly in college. They still have the goods!!!",5
"Gioco was our first choice for our first time dining out in our new neighborhood and I'm so glad we choose it.  They are all about straight forward Italian food and they do it incredibly well. The interior is really nice and they did a good job of creating a great dining space in a relatively small area. We started with a wine recommendation from our server which was excellent.  Next we choose the daily anipasta offering with was veal meatballs, bruschetta and fried tortellini.  While the tortellini was okay, the meatballs were very tasty and the bruschetta had a great mix of garlic and tomatoes.  Even the complimentary bread had an almost peppery & smokey flavor to it that made it better than the normal Italian restaurant bread offering.  For entrees, I choose the tortelloni and my partne",4
"Best pizza I ever! Nuff said...",5

"I love popcorn and have been craving this since I first had a taste of Garrett's popcorn.  I usually just stick with the cheese and caramel one. Unfortunately, this place closes a little early for me. I think around 8pm. I flew into Chicago for Business and we couldn't find a Garret's....we just decided to chow down to a good dinner. Fortunately there's a Garrett's inside ORD at the United terminal. I grabbed a couple of bags and the popcorn was good for a couple of days. yummy!!!",5
"This place is great. From their deep dish pizza to their beer of the month specials, it's all good stuff. Jane, my favorite bartender pours a mean scotch :)",5

"Online ordering AND delivery of ONE sandwich for lunch?! BRILLIANT! When it's sweltering and nauseatingly hot outside, I sometimes don't eat (or don't go out) because I'm too delicate to be beaten by the cruel, cruel sun. I just can't stand it. Today, I ordered my sandwich online. Quick and easy! There are also vegetable choices here (cucumber, sprouts) that I never think of getting in the store (where I often have to repeat my order four times and forget stuff). I swear my sandwich got to me in ten minutes. No apparently delivery fee - how do they do this? And the delivery guy was adorable.",5
"Welcome to the neighborhood Jimmy Green's.   We are so happy to have you!   I agree with previous review that the South Loop was definitely in need of a place of this type.    Jimmy Green's is a modern sports bar offering a creative menu and personable & genuine staff.    They are not scheduled to open until June 5 but got smart by doing a preview opening during the Stanley Cup games.   My boyfriend went to Jimmy Green's for game 1 and enjoyed his experience so we returned for game 2.     We received a friendly greeting from the two guys checking ID's.  The hostess said there were no tables available and told us to check the bar, which clearly was full so don't know why she would even make such a suggestion.    We were a bit annoyed by her tone and fact that she didn't even offer to take o",5
"Eleven City Diner is a great place to go for all-day (as late as midnight on friday and saturday!) breakfast favorites such as pancakes, belgian waffles, french toast (made with challah) and omelettes, and heartier lunch and dinner specials (burgers, hand-cooked and sliced corn beef, etc), in addition to several Jewish specialties - kreplach and matzo ball soup, latkes, and more! There is also a full bar and traditional soda jerk station which serves phosphates and malts. Bring your friends or family, or try it out on your next date! ;D",4
"This is the best pizza east of the mississippi(ny sucks), and the second best pizza i have eaten in my entire life. We randomly found this place while wandering around in Chicago late at night, the inside is really nice, the decor is excellent. We of course got the deep dish, some morons who reviewed it who had never been there tried something else. STUPID. The pizza was damn good, the crust was weird but deep dish pizza crust is different. The cheese was excellent, tons of toppings, and the sauce was fantastic. If you're in Chicago visiting, go there for pizza. It's right across millenium park and close to the lake. This pizza is so good i'd fly to chicago again just to eat it. Great city, GREAT pizza.",5
"I used to eat at a place called Upper Crust Pizza in Atlanta-they closed years ago, but I have missed that wonderful stuffed pizza! I have found it once again at Giordanos!!!!!

"What a great, new, awesome place to eat lunch in the Loop!  My co-workers and I had lunch there today, and it was my first time, but their third time.  They talked about Jason's Deli so highly that I had to try it out, and I'm really not into eating out at lunch when I live right across the street where I can make my own lunch, change into my pjs and lounge for 45 minutes before going to work.  It takes a special place to deter me from going home for lunch. I had The Great Rueben, and wow, it's an accurate title.  The corned beef was perfect, the sauer kraut was German goodness reincarnate, and the size made the price worth it.  I paid $11.38 for the reuben sandwich, chips, a long slice of pickle and a fountain drink plus soft serve ice cream.  The fountain drinks are $1.99 and all you can",5

Also neat: if you live anywhere in the contiguous US outside of Chicago, Giordano's will ship you a half-baked pizza on dry ice for you to finish baking yourself.

Everest is by far the nicest restaurant I have ever been to.  The view is incredible (I've uploaded a photo).  The place was like a museum, though: everyone spoke in hushed tones, and the servers watched us like security guards, wearing suits and saying nothing as they stood with their backs to the wall.

Now, there are some things you do have to note: 1.  If you are going to eat here, make sure that you like the person that you a going here with.  The wait for seating can be long.  If you are ordering a deep dish pizza, it does take 45- 1 hour to cook. 2.  See note above, do not stuff yourself on salad or drinks because 3.  One slice of deep dish pizza is a meal.  No, seriously.  All that cheesy tomato goodness is A LOT.  This is Chicago Style Pizza!!  This Pizza is thick and hearty enough to start a bar brawl.

"Giordano's has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Eating it is an adventure. Know that it takes a while for them to make these pizzas, as they are incredibly deep, robust pies. Also know that you can't eat as much of it as you think you can. Down here in the South, I can polish off a whole frozen Dijourno's by myself, but I honestly can't eat more than two or three slices of a small pizza at Giordano's... three is pushing it. The drink list is decent. There is Guinness. This particular Giordano's has times when it is so busy that it's worth finding another location, but in general the wait times are bearable. Always worth it.",5

The fish and chips here have got t be the absolutely best I have ever tasted and I have tasted fish and chips from many many places. The fish seems to be baked?? Maybe slightly fried??... I am not sure.. But it is not oily, it is crunchy, it is fresh and a nice chunky piece of cod. It comes with perfectly cooked peas.. Absolutely perfectly cooked.... I don't know how they do it, but they make it perfect every time. It is crunchy, but fully cooked. Kudos to Emerald loop!",5

I say try your sandwich Mike's way: onions, oil, vinegar, and Italian seasoning.  They also have this spicy pepper sandwich spread that is vinegary and delicious, and nice thickly sliced pickles.  I allow myself to eat out to lunch once a week, and every week I say I'm'm going to try a new restaurant, but all I can think about is the deliciousness of Jersey Mike's.  And no offense to my fellow yelpers, but Jimmy John's ain't got nothin on Jersey Mike's.",5

"Upon my pending trip to Chicago, I wanted to try as many Chicago Stuffed Pizza places in SD to compare to Giordanos as possible b/c I really wanted a side-by-side comparison while it was fresh in my head. Cut to the first day of our adventures and for lunch we stopped by here and got the sausage stuffed pizza. The biggest difference I noticed was the cheese. It is a little more pungent and tastier than anywhere else that tries to replicate the gem of a pizza they have here. I've gone near and far and no pizza for me tops Giordanos. I don't know what it is, but I love the fullness, meatyness, cheesyness, doughyness of a stuffed pizza.  And I was so proud when my friend (Ashley D.) converted. As stupid and blasphemous as someone can be for not being a fan of pizza, she came around and realiz",5
"you know, it is not legal to sell crack. but somehow, garrett is able to do it legally.... in the form of popcorn. O.M.G. best damn popcorn i've ever had. i bought 2 tins of the chicago mix and 1 large bag of the chicago mix, the lady said my total comes to $79 and i thought WHAT THE HELL!! i just spent $79 on f-ing popcorn. that's right. insane. stupid me. what the hell. but guess what???? IT WAS WORTH IT. come here. buy lots. you won't regret it. it's worth the calories. it's worth the weight gain. it's worth the empty pocket. it's worth the greasy hands. it's worth lugging around. it's worth the long lines. it's worth the popcorn stuck between the teeth. it's worth your clothes smelling like popcorn. it's worth being yelled at by the cashier to hurry up cause there's a ton of people beh",5
"We couldn't come to Chicago without having Chicago style stuffed pizza, now could we?  Who cares if it takes forever for the pizza to show up on your table (takes 30-40 minutes to cook I guess), it's DELICIOUS.  There is a nice courtyard type area right in front with a fountain feature, which came quite in handy while we tried to entertain our 12.5 month old son during the wait.  The crust makes the pizza!   p.s.  that's our little guy on my avatar at this Giordano's location.  He loved it, too!",5
"My husband & I love this place! We recommend the Thai chicken salad and the bangers/mash. Yummy! This place has a huge smoking and afterwork crowd. Beware if you don't like smoking and have a social phobia. (strangely I hate smoking but it didn't really bother me & when I got home I didn't smell too bad) You will have to muscle in to get a drink if you get there after 5pm. I have not been in on a weekend but I heard its nuts (packed). If you are lucky enough to chat with the bar manager Mary, do so, she is the best! Her tales of her backpacking in Ireland are hilarious!",5
"I really have wanted to try many things on the menu, but I can't. I always get the Madison and can't stray. The wraps look great, but this sandwich is perfection on bread. I always get the guacamole and chips with it instead of the normal side, which is so worth it for an extra dollar. Very generous portions too. I've convinced my work to cater from this place and we're addicted. I'd would eat here everyday if I could afford to eat out that much!",5
"If you go here, you have to get the Chicago deep dish.  You aren't really experiencing Giordano's if you get a hand tossed pizza here.  Also, the spinach artichoke dip is incredible.  One small pizza deep dish was enough for me and my sister after the spin dip. You gotta know you will have to wait probably an hour or more if you go there for dinner.  If you are 21, you can knock a few back in the bar section while you wait for your table.  It's also really close to the Chicago Conrad hotel.  We just walked there and it took about 4 or 5 minutes.",5
"Favorite Jamba Juice ever. There is always a large group of people waiting off to the side for their smoothies, which always scares me into thinking there's a long wait, and I may not need that smoothie after all. But I do need that smoothie, so I go anyway. Even though there's tons of people, I've never waited more than five minutes. The workers are always super friendly and talk to the customers, but it doesn't slow them down or get in the way of them doing their work. Plus, whenever I ask for the recipes to be changed, they never pause or give me weird/angry looks; they just do it how I want, no questions asked. Also, unlike other Jamba Juice locations, their blenders work. I don't get large chunks of fruit and ice, but an actual smoothie. Yum.",5
"yum!!!! when im in chicago i get one about every day, their smoothies are so refreshing and tasty and i wish there was one in saint louis :-(.",4
"simply amazing.  i thought to myself, really?  how good can this popcorn really be?  i'm sure it's not as good as all the hype.  well it was all that and more!  i couldn't stop eating it and didn't care that i was making a scene while doing so!  the only bad thing was i left my bag on my tour bus.  :(",5
"Ode to Garrett Popcorn: When I think about you, I lick my hand. Combo bag, carmel and cheddar. So delicious, I scare myself, scare my friend. Can't share anymore, give me the bag. Hand is orange, face is too. I don't care, All I want is you!",5
"AMAZING!  Best Pizza and a nice place to eat.",5
"My favorite lunch spot in the loop.  Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious, and they are very good about modifications to the standard fare (as one who loathes sour cream, this is key).  The food is varied - sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc - so there is something for everyone.   I lean towards the wraps, which come with chips, salsa, and guac.  Personally, the salsa is a little spicy, but they always let me swap it for a guac instead.",5
"FREAKING AWESOME. The Epic Burger: All natural beef patties (no hormones included) topped with fresh organic everything: onions (grilled or raw), lettuce, tomatoes, special sauce. Served on a fresh local bakery baked whole grain bun. Fresh cut fries, crispy and delicious. Even the ketchup on the table is organic. And yes, you CAN tell the difference (even if it may be all in your head). You betcha, it's a better burger than any burger you've ever had, EVER.",5
"Man, this place knows how to rock the deep dish pizza.  I discovered some reviews on yelp, and since then it's been in the lunch rotation.  It takes a while to make-and count on it taking the full 45 minutes-but they remind you about this when you order, and you can always call them ahead of time so your pizza will be ready when you arrive.  I'd never ventured further than their pizza until our office had one of our retirement parties there.  Oh man.  For a little over twenty bucks we had pop, beer, and wine for drinks.  Our package included ceasar salad, chicken, beef kabob, potatoes, and on and on.  So tasty.  What really impressed me was they kept refilling everything, even when it seemed like everyone was winding down.  Oh, and when we were done, they brought out a bunch of to go boxes",5
"I'm not a Jamba Juice-r... I get one maybe 2 or 3 times a year... I never crave it... I came in because my friend had a buy one get one coupon and we needed to get far away from working at the Taste.. BUT OMG if all Jamba Juices were this fun I would go here morning, noon, and night. The staff is very nice and know how to have a good time. Highlight of my day: two guys - one customer and one JJ employee (maybe they knew each other? who cares) dancing to the complete Beyonce Single Ladies single. Yes, they were coordinated and knew the whole thing. I had great seats, and everyone passing by was stopping to take videos and pictures As far as the drinks - it was just... normal.",5
"I ordered a deep dish pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza and although it took an hour for it to be delivered, it was well worth the wait.  The pizza was filled with cheese and yummy goodness and the crust is so addicting - it is buttery and light and just the perfect combo for a carb lover.  I could only eat 2 pieces before passing out but so good - a must try!  I also heard that the spinach stuffed pizza was good too - try this place!",5
"Great food and service. Enjoyed the shrimp pasta with a side salad.I highly recommend this dish. At many restaurants the pasta is to starchy or the cream sauce over powers the rest of the dish. Giordanos creates the perfect balance. I've only been here once while on a business trip and would ensure to go back when in Chicago.",5
"Can I say, AMAZING!!! I love this place.  I had a turkey burger and my husband had a beef burger. The ingredients are all organic and you can taste it. They're just so simple. Meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions on a fresh baked bun. The bun its self is so yummy. Anyway, don't like writing long reviews so I'll just say this.........TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF!!!!!",5
"I know it's pretty silly to write reviews on chain restaurants/businesses, but occasionally there are a few locations that stand out from others ... either negatively or positively. This Jamba Juice is within a stone's throw from my school. When I have a hankering for healthy (or 'healthy') eats, this is one of my favorite establishments. Yes, their smoothies are always delicious, but Jamba Juice recently started offering actual eats. While there are plenty of eateries in the Loop, not too many are vegetarian-friendly, healthy, AND fast. Take for example their Greens & Grains Wrap (update: no longer available). It's vegan, with red quinoa, field greens, and hummus. Included is a mango vinaigrette. I normally dislike fruity dressing, but it's actually a great match. I just tried the Greek G",4
"Even when I felt like I was on death's door, I found my first experience to Gioco to be wonderful. We had great service from Marcello and friendly interactions with everyone else. The menu was amazing; many options spoke to me but I managed to restrain myself and order just one entree...After a glass of wine and sharing the Caprese appetizer (which had amazing olive oil on it) I ate as much of the Prosciutto pizza I ordered as possible. Never one to pass up dessert if I have room, I sampled the chocolate cake on Marcello's recommendation for something good to share. It was warm and delicious. Everything was very good and reminded me of being in a restaurant on Bologna! The place is seriously charming! And the South Loop locale is great; very close to the Brown Line.",5
"I have been to this place many many times. The service here is always great and the food is always tasty and good. The fish and chips here have got t be the absolutely best I have ever tasted and I have tasted fish and chips from many many places. The fish seems to be baked?? Maybe slightly fried??... I am not sure.. But it is not oily, it is crunchy, it is fresh and a nice chunky piece of cod. It comes with perfectly cooked peas.. Absolutely perfectly cooked.... I don't know how they do it, but they make it perfect every time. It is crunchy, but fully cooked. Kudos to Emerald loop!",5
"this Jimmy John's gets 5 stars for service. they rock. i walk in and get greeted by 2 people, one at the counter and one in the back. every customer got a 'Hello! Welcome!' and a 'Thanks for coming! Have a great day!!!' and, of course, the sandwiches are good too!",5
"What a terrible place! We ordered the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and gravy. Well, I don't want gravy on my sandwich....gross...so we asked for no gravy. It comes out open face, 1 piece of bread (no top bread), no gravy (thank GOD!) but also no cranberry sauce and the turkey was super dry! God, it was terrible!",1
"This just in: Barefooted babies are the cause of all the world's ills. Or something like that.

"My family has been eating at Giordano's for over 25 years and  this location at Prudential Plaza has ruined my experience with them. My wife and I live in the loop and have had nothing but bad experiences with this location. A few of their servers are condescending and most of the staff treat us like tourists. A little over a month ago, we decided to go over to this location and have dinner, but the wait was over an hour, so we switched to take-out and waited for our pizza. It should have taken 40 minutes, but ended up being close to an hour and ten minutes before they informed us they had given our pizza away by accident. Instead of giving us a free pizza for the 2 hour wait for our pizza, they gave us 3 dollars off and sent us on our way. There was little apology for the mix-up. Once aga",1

"OK.  We just got back to NY from Chicago last night and I just reviewed Glenn's Diner and Yolk (both very good) and I had to put my 2 cents in about this place too.  I saw Giordano's on TV and I have to say that THE PIZZA SUCKS here.  Even if I didn't think that NY pizza rules, the crust here was just awful and the tomato sauce tastes like the crap you get if you are dumb enough to order Italian food at a diner.  We went to Lou Malnati's a few days earlier and that was pretty good (for deep dish pizza, that is) as were the other dishes we saw people eating there.  Other people near us at Giordano's ordered other dishes and they looked just awful too (a plate of fried, really greasy looking appetizers, calamari that looked tough and hard).  I mentioned to my husband that I hoped that their ",1

"This place is bad. When I visited here the entire restaurant had one waitress covering all the tables @ around 5:30PM.  Granted there were only two tables when I walked in, but by the time I left (at around 7:30PM) there were at least 15 tables with only one waitress covering the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, the service was slow. Pizza itself is un-amazing.  Bland sauce combined with 'fresh' mozarella cheese and uninspiring bread.  If I were to make a pizza from scratch at home, my oven would make a better one.  I was hoping to taste the good 'Chicago-style' pizza, and what I got was something worse than Papa John's. Summary... bad pizza, bad service, overpriced.  Don't visit.",1
"Ick. Ball of cheese. I went with three friends on a recent trip to Chicago and we all thought the pizza needed more crust, more filling, and more sauce; anything but more cheese! We all left feeling sad and confused- is that really what Chicago deep dish is supposed to be like? I've certainly enjoyed the deep dish I've had in other cities, including San Francisco, much better.",1
"F this F'ing place!  This place is an absolute joke.  We kind of stumbled upon this place last night (yes stumbled, even though you need a map to find it).  We decided at the last minute to try this place out, and what a mistake it was.  The only thing more smug, pompous, pretentious, dull, arrogant, shallow, miserable, stuffy, fake, and annoying then the service staff were the actual other customers.  Our head waiter (if that's what they are even called) was possibly the most annoying creature on the planet.  We went with the 3 course meal, and when we selected the salad as our appetizer, he rudely insisted we get something else like lobster, oysters, etc.  I finally had to tell him that we ordered the salad because that is what we wanted, so move along.  Why even list the salad as an opt",1

We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again.

ALL of my credit card information, name, address ect, were stolen to make a fraudulent XBOX live account, which charged 74.99 to my debit card. The reason that I suspect that is was someone employed at this location, is this account was created and closed the same evening of my Jimmy John's order.  The reason I suspect that it is someone employed at this location, is because it is the only instance that someone would have had access to not only my credit card information, but also my name an add",1

We arrived at this restaurant and saw empty tables, so we thought a table for two would be easy. The manager explained that they did not have enough servers to service all of the tables, so we'd have to wait for a table. He said it would be a long wait.

However I made the mistake of ordering one the beers on the menu and the waiter looked at me like I was barefoot and had food in my teeth. If you don't want people ordering beer then don't put it on the menu. God forbid someone ordered a beer at Everest. I was wondering if they were going to put my picture up on the wall as the first person to ever be so uncouth as to order a beer. Then it took 20 minutes for him to bring it to my table.

I understand that these pizzas take a while to cook and a long wait is the norm, so I wasn't going to make a big deal about it, but it mattered to my friend. The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary. Then the manager ripped the pizza out of my friend's hands and charged his card back and yelled 'THERE, now you can go wait somewhere else for your meal!!'.

"As a caveat I did not eat here. Tried to, but was unsuccessful due to the fact that they booked a party of 215 people (a high school field trip) for dinner at 6:30 pm. They might as well have just shut down the entire restaurant during this time because there were only a handful of tables available for other diners, and all the students lining up in the middle of the restaurant to get their food buffet style was very chaotic. I waited with my party for at least 20 mins, but no tables were called during this time at all, and I realized we would not get seated until the field trip had left the building.

And today I even asked them to double check that it was right and it was STILL wrong! I think it's because no one who works there speaks English.

Now I've had deep dish pizza before.  Houston is a big, diverse town with transplants from New York and Chicago who open up restaurants and bring their local cuisine to our Gulf coast shores, so to speak. I've enjoyed the deep dish Joe's pizza (spinach and sauteed garlic with chunky tomato sauce) at our very own Star Pizza.   So, on our last day in Chicago, I convince my work mates that we absolutely must indulge in a deep dish pizza before we leave.  They acquiesce, but not knowing the town and being limited on time, we ask one ",1

"Meh, this place used to be okay.  The food was usually decent - we liked the cornbeef, the chili cheese fries and the salads.   We ate there plenty of times until we wisen'd up a bit.  Read below... First off, the food is very expensive for what it is.  Its a glorified diner - which means that lunch for two shouldn't be $65.  Way too pricey.  Service is mediocrity at its finest.  One may think to blame the wait staff for this, but alas, its really not their fault.  Look who they have to deal with on a daily basis.  Keep reading... The owner/manager, Brad Rubin, is a real character.  And by 'character', I mean 'prick.' He treats his employees like dog shit on his shoe.  That attitude translates to his patrons. This guy has a huge chip on his shoulder and I'm still trying to figure out why. ",1
"I came here because of the great reviews on Chowhound, but I wish someone had told me the following:  At Giordano's you will pay $25+ for a small pizza that tastes like cardboard.  Literally, the pizza is cooked on cardboard.  This is a huge no-no for flavor and texture. Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable.  I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least.  This happen to anyone else? There has to be good deep dish pizza in Chicago, I just don",1

The falafel sandwich is barely passable and the veggie plate is ok. i go here on those cold days where i can walk across the walkway and pick up a bite without having to dress up to go outside.

"Probably one of the most mediocre, slowest, and overpriced places in the area. None of the items on the menu really stand out.

Especially when all you've ordered is a sandwich that doesn't require much prep.",1
"F this F'ing place!  This place is an absolute joke.  We kind of stumbled upon this place last night (yes stumbled, even though you need a map to find it).  We decided at the last minute to try this place out, and what a mistake it was.  The only thing more smug, pompous, pretentious, dull, arrogant, shallow, miserable, stuffy, fake, and annoying then the service staff were the actual other customers.  Our head waiter (if that's what they are even called) was possibly the most annoying creature on the planet.  We went with the 3 course meal, and when we selected the salad as our appetizer, he rudely insisted we get something else like lobster, oysters, etc.  I finally had to tell him that we ordered the salad because that is what we wanted, so move along.  Why even list the salad as an opt",1

"I've been a regular since they opened several years ago but the place is going down hill and I probably won't be back. I usually stop in before work for a coffee and a yogurt.  They used to make their yogurt  with fresh fruit but now use some sort of liquid substance with chunks of soft objects that may look like fruit but taste like sewer matter. I had generally liked the coffee in the past and the fact they have a variety of flavors. Though, I learned early on to never order the iced coffee. They keep a jug full of stale coffee in a fridge and serve it to you in a cup of ice. It's nasty. I also was very bummed out this morning when the cup of pumpkin coffee I received had no pumpkin taste at all but seemed to be some lame generic decaf.

"Ghostbar is an overpriced and 'wannabe' swanky joint.  I went for a large social event where everyone was classy and spending big bucks, but we somehow managed to receive horrible service.  Our bartender, Dion (yes, I called him out) was super rude and clearly hadn't had any customer service training.  It was bad enough that the drinks were overpriced and very weak, but then to have Dion go off on me and my friends was the most uncouth thing I have ever experienced. This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous. I can only assume that is the reason the individual tipped lightly.  But, that was none of my business because my friends and I had been leaving hefty tips all evening. When I asked Dion for another dr",1

It was due a little complain about the pizza we ordered. We order the veggie without broccoli and we get the pizza with the broccoli plus the 45 minutes to get the order completed. The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged. I talked to the manager and he said that he did not approved anything and he directly said that we ",1
"My husband and I liked this place at first, we moved from the East Coast to the South Loop and 11th city reminded us of diners at home.  The food was always overpriced but the service usually made up for it so we went somewhat frequently.  The more we went the more we were turned off by the obnoxious owner/manager whoever he is.  If you've ever eaten there, you know who I'm talking about.  The last time we were there, we brought some friends that were visiting from NY.  As we were finishing up the owner sat down at our table and asked if we minded if he fixed his boot.  We were all a little confused as to why that was necessary but as he sits down he says, 'So is this your first time here?'  I answered that we had been there before, and his response, 'OH So why do you keep coming back?'  R",1

Was with an older woman who had a back problem. Her husband let us out at the door and went to park the car.

I've witnessed more drama between Brad and the staff than I can recall.  Some of the memorable bits include dressing-downs of the hostesses in front of the large waiting weekend crowds, screams lobbed across the restaurant, and awkward, unnecessarily confrontational encounters between Brad and customers confused by his many rules.

I waited with my party for at least 20 mins, but no tables were called during this time at all, and I realized we would not get seated until the field trip had left the building.

I've walked by this place numerous times-- put off as well as intrigued by the fact that the restaurant is a green shack about the size of a living room.

I was so excited that even the weird chemically cucumbery smell that hit me when I picked up the food didn't diminish my excitement. But it should've. My wonton soup was bland and the wontons were mushy. My fried rice contained what seemed like less than one sliced Oscar Meyer hot dog and the rest was just unflavorfully mushy rice.

We started with the antipasto salad which was good, kinda a pain to eat with entire slices of cold cuts lying across the top of the salad, but once cut up was pretty good.  The little one wanted the mozzerella sticks, so we ordered those too - nothing special - just like ones you'd get at a bowling alley.

"red brick's pizza tastes better than giordanos thin crust i have to say. the stuffed crust is overrated too. but if you're visiting chicago for the first time i guess you'd still want to get this part (the part where you find out for yourself what the buzz over chicago pizza is) over with. once is enough though. and one slice is enough. the waitress was very nice. their meatballs were moist, and not overcooked like most meatballs ive tasted. but as far as pizza goes, ive certainly had better.",2

"Most likely due to its prime downtown Chicago location, the prices are too high for what they are selling.  I ordered two Chicago style hot dogs, fries, and a Mountain Dew for $7 & change.  The dogs were of low quality - the meat had little taste, and the toppings left much to be desired.  They were skimpy on the tomatoes, the relish was an unnatural neon green color, and they put way too much celery salt on it.   Save your money and treat your stomach by skipping this place and going to Clark Street Dog instead.  Their hot dog toppings are deliciously fresh and they charge less for it.",2

I do not care for their pizza, and the menu offers little else that's even remotely appetizing. This location is set up kind of cramped - we couldn't stop bumping elbows wherever we sat. Despite the close quarters, for whatever reason, every server we've had has somehow missed 2-3 people at a big table. Very odd. The thing that killed the outings was when we showed up with a reservation twice in a row, and they couldn't sit us all together - some were in booths, others were at a table in a different room...it was really awkward and irritating.

"Went to Gioco this past weekend with LK on our 'date night' before seeing the movie 'Date Night' and while we were not mistaken for another couple and subject to the capers that ensue in the movie we may have been better off skipping the night out and renting something on DVD. First off the place is pretty cool inside. Kind of a two tiered layout with a hip vintage feel to it. Bottles of wine all over the room and a neat open kitchen that makes you feel like part of the action but also makes sitting too close to the kitchen a little warmer than I find comfortable. Our server was fantastic - but I can't think of his name. He had some great input on our wine selection and his descriptions of the menu were very helpful. We started off with the mussels appetizer as per the recommendation of ma",2

C) The service was so stripped down, with inexperienced waitstaff, that dawdled the absolute VAST majority of the time.  Every table was looking around looking for their server.  I watched our food be plated and served up in the window, while our server kinda aimlessly walked around the room ignoring everyone.

The selection of British beer is impressive and there are 8+ selections on draft.  The food is standard pub fare.  Unfortunately, the kitchen did not have a few of our first-choice appetizers due to the holiday.  Through process of elimination, we settled on potato skins, bruschetta, and onion rings.  Lots of deep fried options.

In a blind taste test, I don't know that I could pick them out from frozen. I've never had a stellar meal at any of the KDKs, though they've all been reliably expensive and over-hyped. I'm glad other people have enjoyed their meals. Maybe I'll have better luck at Opera. . .",2

I love my sauce too, and this just didn't do it for me. i felt like I had been robbed of my chicago deep dish experience.",2

"I don't get it.  The service was fine, and the appetizers were ok, but the pizza was not good at all.  I've had plenty of deep dish before, but this was essentially melted cheese on a plate (and this is coming from somebody who loves cheese).  The crust isn't that good and the sauce is so non-existent that i couldn't tell you how it tastes.  This might be a tourist spot, but if you live in the city, you can definitely find better.",2

As a wee tike, the Dom enjoyed herself a good slice of pie of the deep dish persuasion from said eatery.

"I've been to the Emerald Loop twice now.  I did not eat either time, however.  But, the drinks are strong and that gets them an A-OK. Each time I went it was later in the evening.  Both times there was a big crowd and the atmosphere was fun.  The servers are attentive, the bartenders are fast, and the seating is plentiful. Both times I ordered a dirty martini and both times I was not that impressed with the overall taste, plus the bartender reached into the olive dish with his bare hands (toothpick, please) to get the olives for my drink...where have his hands been?  Ew.  So I stuck to vodka/tonics after that, and they were good. A good spot if you are in the loop.  Laid back, good crowd, strong drinks.",3
"You know, I don't know what the fuss is about this pizza. I found the sauce bland and the dough ok. I tried their deep dish, which they are known for. Wasn't impressed. I was, by far, blown away by their pasta.",3
"I typically frequent the Dearborn/Kinzie location which is stellar, but decided to drop by this location on a busy Mother's Day morning just to grab something hot and quick since my favorite brunch places were likely crammed with families celebrating the holiday.   There were only two other customers and they were seated already... so I was able to walk in, was greeted quickly and had my order in a few minutes.  I'm not sure why the other reviews of this location aren't as good, but the staff was courteous and efficient. Maybe they've made some changes?",1
"Went here for two occassions. Once for Mother's Day and another time for a benefit.  I'll start with the Mother's Day experience. We were there before the dinner rush, so we had attentive service. Our waitress was very sharp and friendly.  The food was good. Mom enjoyed it! :) The benefit experience...that was a little different.  The staff was rude. The party room was packed and they probably should have offered us a bigger room or consulted with the hosting the party about the number guests.   I would still return to the Emerald Loop for lunch or dinner again.",3
"The pizza was good but the service was poor. With all the restaurants in the city I will choose to go some place else.",3
"You learn a lot of things on bus tours. (yes, I was THAT tourist that took a bus tour, don't judge, I wanted to see more of Downtown and I was too tired to walk) Ours informed us that deep dish pizza was actually made and rejected by Texans in Texas, but was well received when the guy took the idea to Chicago. So be it. I'm not a fan of the idea of deep dish. Too much cheese, too much bread for my taste. How is everyone not huge from enjoying this stuff? There wasn't that long of a wait for a table for our large group, plus. We ordered a fried appetizer sampler platter, a large thin crust style pizza and a deep dish for one of the ladies. And pitchers of beer, holla. Everything seemed to be legit until our waiter informed us he forgot to place our order. Nice. They may have expedited the f",3
"KInd of hard to find, tucked away on the second floor of the Renaissance Hotel.  It's a bright airy room with large skylight, light wood and lots of windows. When we arrived at 11:30 there wasn't anyone in the room - no one to greet us, no staff.  We thought it was closed.  Then someone showed up and asked if we would like a table.  Weird.  Once seated next to a window overlooking Wacker Drive and the Chicago River, things were fine.  Service was attentive and professional. Menu had interesting salad, sandwich and light entree choices.  The artichoke flan entree was delicious -- two little baked artichoke rounds, grilled portabello, peppers, greens and a roasted pepper puree.  Beautiful presentation. We had a warm pear tart with almond topping for dessert.  Overall a good choice for a leis",3

"This is more of a 3.5, I cannot bring myself to give it 4 full stars. I met my cousin's fiance here for lunch since we both work downtown and it was nice. I'm so glad we agreed to meet at 11:30 instead of 12 because people started pouring in at 11:45 and by the end of the meal I felt like our waitress was trying to rush us out a little bit. If you meet somebody for lunch, either meet early or late unless you don't mind waiting around. I got a good look around and I really liked the decor and the whole ambience of the place, and I love the faux fireplace that we ended up sitting by, a little bit of romance I say. I got a Chicken Wrap of sorts, I don't remember the exact name, and got a Caeser salad on the side and it was all quite tasty for bar food, though I did not like the cheese on the ",3
"I don't know, I am on the fence about giving this place a 3 or a 4 star rating.   4 stars...because I liked the pizza, I liked the atmosphere, and I like the history behind this pizza chain?   3 stars because nothing moved me and in all due respect, they should step up and play a better game, especially in a city where pizza restaurant per capita is probably one of the highest in the US? 3 stars.  And here is why The Goods: 1. I got the traditional cheese pizza and the signature pizza with the sausage and onions.  Very flavorful - generous toppings, good quality cheese, and the crust was decent. 2. Tomato sauce - I almost got the sense that they were being a bit stingy with tomato sauce with me, I am not sure if this is truly Chicago-style, but I was getting a bit overwhelmed by the toppin",3
"I like Gioco.  For a long time, it was one of the few nice restaurants in the neighborhood, but others have opened, and now, there's a nice mix of restaurants around now.  Gioco has dependable Italian cuisine, and good wines to compliment the food.  The atmosphere is nice and the wait staff is friendly.",3
"Came for the first time a few days ago. I ordered the Original Italian - Mike's Way without onions. The veggies were fresh and he put a good amount of the vinegar and seasoning, but I still felt it was bland. I did like that cornmeal like crunch that the bottom of the bread had. They are pricier than other sandwich shops. I'm not sure if I would return, but the workers there were all very nice. Very clean inside. Also, boo they offer Pepsi and not Coke.",2

I also wanted something good and different for lunch today so I'd thought I would give epic a try.  After all they have some pretty good reviews.  They have the all natural thing going so i've been on the natural kick lately and wanted to try it.  I got the epic burger combo on a wheatbun +1 star. Natural hand cut fries +1 star.  Quick service, guess what, +1 star.   Nice overall.  Burger was juicy, added some bacon just cause I can (everything is better with bacon).  I'm not sure about epic's special sauce, it's kinda blah.   I'll forgo it next time.  And yes there will be a next time.  Its close to work and has good food... How can I not go back.   I'm sick and tired of the avg food around here(chinese/sandwiches/pizza, etc).   I need v",3
"Always a nice experience, but this place is NOT about the food - it is all about the ambiance. The menu issolid, though not very exotic.. definitely very Irish/UK. I only think of it when meeting friends in the loop after work for drinks, because that is exactly the kind of place it is :)",3
"I stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chi town for a business trip and had breakfast as well as an evening drink and desert here. It is a local pub with a busy evening crowd that is lively. The dining room is actually pretty inviting, and mirrors a living room, with book shelves, comfy chairs, etc. It is kind of dark, but what you would expect from a pub. I had a nice breakfast here of a veggie omelet, fruit, whole wheat bread and decent coffee. It was fresh, fast and the service was very nice. It was fine for a breakfast. I also came down to have a drink with a coworker and some desert. The desert was really good, some kind of apple and berry crisp with ice cream. The drinks were WAY overpriced for this type of place! A cosmo was $12 and a double of whisky (you needed a double, otherwise",3

"I've been to Jason's Deli a couple of times.  They are pretty legit when it comes to lunch.  Portions are big and prices are pretty comparable to the next guy.  Both times I've been to Jason's I ate the big chef salad.  A huge salad loaded with ham, turkey, Swiss, cheddar cheese, tomatoes and black olives.  The first time I got my salad to go and they gave me the wrong dressing.  Instead of ranch I was given 1000 Island which is probably one of my least favorite dressing.  Not sure if I was so hungry or the salad was just that good but I was able to eat it without dressing and was still completely satisfied.  The second time I went I dined it and the salad seemed twice as big as a to-go salad.  You get to go up to the salad bar to get your own dressing and I had the lite ranch... amazing.

"I have been to this location twice..once for a private party downstairs and once for after work drinks.  Cheesy holiday decorations aside, this place is a pretty safe bet if you're in the area.  The private party was done very well and they appetizers were super yummy.   They were also able to accommodate a party of 6 with no problem on a weeknight and they have a good selection of beer available.  I tried the chicken quesadillas which weren't the best I've ever eaten but they did the job after two quick drinks.   I would definitely stop back in here to try some of their other menu items.",3
"I've been too tough on E&C. Sure, it's not going to give any new revelations on comfort food, but I'm glad that it's here, and even more glad that I work near here again. The chicken pot pie was tasty after a long day of work, but a bit of a small portion. Crust was nice and crispy, but I couldn't care less for green beans and (even) the garlic mashed potatoes that came with it. Just fill me up on pot pie! Service was really quick, and I love the 20 oz. Imperial Pint pours. The Guiness was just what the Weatherman ordered, and went perfectly with the chix pot pie. I am definitely going to make this a lunch and afterwork pop-in staple, now that I'm downtown again.",3
"Someone may jump out of a bush and whack me after I write this but I like Chicago Popcorn Works better than Garrett's.  I have DREAMs about the competition's chipotle cheese kernels!  On the flip side, Garrett's cheese popcorn doesn't really do it for me - it's pretty greasy and doesn't have that exquisite cheese flavor.  It's not BAD (I will definitely do some damage if it's put in front of me) but not the best in my opinion. Garrett does make the BEST caramel popcorn, I'll give him that.  Mix the cheese and the caramel together and a magical lovechild is born! Garrett Popcorn Shop is a Chicago institution (this location isn't as bad but have you seen those lines on Michigan??).  If you're a first timer, order the Chicago Mix.  It won't disappoint.",1
"Pretty awful service but the pizza was very good.",2
"I'm not a fan of popcorn like I used to be, but don't let my rating fool you! The popcorn is realy good and the lines are ALWAYS long. The Chicago Mix is really good (caramel and cheese), but I prefer mines separate. :)",3
"Great little place actually, really no complaints. . . Other than they ring up the wrong price for the food everytime I go in there.  Coincidentally it is always higher.  Granted it is only 50 cents here and 80 cents there, but if they are doing this to everyone they are making a boat load more money than they advertise their prices at. So keep an eye on the woman at the cash register.  I know I am being stingy but it happens everytime. I can't help feeling I am slowly being robbed. Otherwise a great place, Ha!",2
"I have been here several times now (I don't like to review on a single visit) and wish I could give more stars, but for now, three will have to do. Went there last night for the first time since the 're-opening' and we were greeted by the very friendly new manager, and were seated quickly. I didn't study the menu too closely (I knew what I wanted), but it looks pretty much like it used to. We started with the antipasto tasting thingy...and it really was amazing. It was an excellent combo of all the things I would have ordered normally, including my new favorite thing in the world - burrata. The bread was also really great. I had a beer and BF had an iced tea, and when we were finishing the antipasto waiter came by to see if BF wanted another iced tea, and rushed off as I yelled out to him ",2
"I've taken several visitors to Chicago here due to the close proximity to all the tourist attractions in the Loop.  It's a good intro to Chicago deep-dish, but not my favorite.  I don't think I've ever had fantastic service, and sometimes got the feeling the wait staff just wanted to get us out as fast as possible (not an easy thing when waiting 45 minutes for a pizza).",3
"Came here for drinks after a long day and was pleasantly surprised.  I had read some previous Yelper and was a little concerned, but it wasn't my suggestion to go here and I was willing to try a new place to see for myself.  I can understand why some people apparently don't like Exchequer, but there's still plenty to like! There's plenty of TVs to watch the game that was on, I had no problems with dirty glasses or silverware and I liked the dark pub feel to the place.  Granted, it took a little while for our waitress to find us, but once she did, she was great and made sure we didn't run short on beer or anything else we needed.  Granted, she didn't seem to enthused about reading us the entire beer list, but then again I don't know if I would be either.  She warned us ahead of time about t",3
"This place was super happening from the outside. Packed to the brim!  There were so many people I could barely move and it was a huge pain to get a drink at the bar. We showed up right around 6pm on a Friday night which would explain the abundance of people and despite my annoyance in the beginning, it was still a pretty fun bar. We stayed there for a few hours as well and it definitely cleared out once the happy hour rush left to pursue other Friday evening endeavors. The drinks were also a bit pricey I think but is to be expected at a bar right in the downtown loop area. While I didn't eat any food when here, I happened to see more than a few tantalizing dishes pass my way while enjoying my beverage. I would come back here but I'd have to be in a pretty good mood where crowds won't bothe",3
"Sign up for the Hop on Off Tour, and get a free sample coupon for here that will give you a sample big enough for a meal!! Their cheddar and caramel mixed bag is pretty tasty, but the caramel is definitely the winner in the battle of the bag. The cheddar is good, don't get me wrong, but it does turn your fingers kind of yellow and the taste of the cheddar just fills you up way faster than the caramel which is maybe a good thing so you don't over eat this stuff ha ha My brother and I couldn't finish our two samples without getting too full or done with the flavor, but it is no wonder this place is so famous in the theater district. The second this place opened that morning, there was already a line of people waiting to pick up bags of popcorn for their offices! And the bags you can buy here",3
"This place just opened up....whats going on with the food? What is wrong with Chicago....we aren't a little no name town that can't dish out good eats  (small towns probably have better food) !     I had the chili-cheese fries. I hadn't had this in over 10 years. I guess 10 years ago they tasted better than they do now! The fries were dry, the chili was canned, the cheese like butter. Overall the dish didn't please my eyes or my stomach. I stopped eating after a couple of fries. I could already see the outcome of finishing that muck. I gave this place 3 stars because they had a really nice grand opening, with a song + dance. I also had their strawberry shake, it was pretty damn good...cheaper than Potbelly's, so I'm sold! I'm willing to go back and try their chicken strips.....",2
"Went here after STYLECHICAGO event.  I love booths so that was a plus.  We all ordered a beer (four of us) and then we decided to do apps...we got spinach artichoke dip (full size), then you could do like small plates.  We got sweet potato fries, veggie spring rolls, pretzels, pot stickers, some other chicken thing, and something else I cant remember.  It was pretty standard bar food.  The waiter was consistently checking on us, which was nice.  We each only ended up paying $16 and something for food and drink...it was a cheapy, bar place.  Just what we were looking for.",3
"As clueless hungry tourists, our desperation drove us to what appeared to be a standard looking pizzeria. Hopeful, we thought it might not have even been a chain. Wrong! Nice to know, though, that we can dine in the company of our fellow tourists, it's comforting.   I did not have Chicago style pizza on my list of must-have eats while being a tourist here, but it was desperate times. We got the stuffed pizza, with pineapple and ham. To tide us over for the 35 minute preparation time, we got a caprese salad. The caprese was made with what appeared to be ginormous slabs of mozzarella, pale unripened tomatoes and a few grassy strands of basil. The mozz was good, at least, I happily ate that and hoarded the leftover plate of balsamic for dipping my hefty pizza crusts into. Pizza was okay, noth",3
"A great lunch spot in the loop, but it's usually pretty packed.  I would recommend coming in a little early or after the noon rush.  That said, their dishes are a great change from the normal sandwich/soup/salad joint.  I've never been disappointed by the food, but sometimes the service is less than can be desired.  I am always jealous of the people that seem to be able to drink at lunch...

"really, three and a half stars. after all, chicago pizza is never just a-ok. the low rating here is because of the atmosphere. it's hardly authentic, and looks more like an applebee's than a traditional chicago pizza parlor. but after forty minutes of feeling displaced, the pizza arrives, and you lose yourself in the aroma, the cheese, the tomato, the crust, ooooooh. i've been to more authentic giordano's [worth four stars], but still prefer uno, due and gino's east to the chain.",3
"Not bad for a pub thats overpriced.",3
"I don't love pizza (or most italian-american food), but the gratuitous amount of cheese on Giordano's pizza makes me happy. Unfortunately, with so much cheese on the pizza, it's difficult to taste the toppings. Still, it's better than any deep dish I've had back home in Los Angeles.",3

"Giordano's suffers from an incorrect C:C:S ratio (crust:cheese:sauce). Way too much crust. And it's not even real crust, it's like a loaf of bread that's been rolled into a circle and happens to have some toppings on it. If you're the sort of pizza eater who loves eating breadsticks and ripping off the back 'wall' of pizza crust so you can dip it in marinara sauce or garlic butter, then you probably enjoy Giordano's a lot. Frankly, I don't understand the appeal. But they do have a good lunch special - $5 for a baby stuffed pizza.",2

A bunch of guys from the office came to a lunch meeting with what appeared to be delicious Mediterranean food, and claimed to have gotten from THE VERY BUILDING our office is in. Score - maybe no more walking to Haifa? Well, it's not as Mediterranean (at least at lunch) as I thought. Their specialty seems to be turkey, which was good, as far as turkey goes. Several gents in the office are hooked on it - multiple visits a week. They have a good collection of sides too, mashed potatoes, corn, etc. Even cranberry sauce. So, I had the turkey platter - which was good, not out of the ordinary. It was a ton of food for not much money though - there's definite value h",3

"I want to love it since deli food typically makes me happy, but I've found my most visits to be just so-so. The owner greets you when you show and there's usually a wait, although I've found it to go pretty fast. You'll get the true NY Deli experience with the owner because he can be a bit obnoxious and condescending. Someone needs to remind him his restaurant is located in Chicago! On this past visit we were in a bit of a rush and were worried we wouldn't be out in time to make our movie. Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte were waiting us!

They are all greened out, with detailed info about their food sourcing and the corn plastic, which I love. But those bitches are pricey as a motherfucker. Two blts and one order of fries? Um, like $20 - what in the fuck just happened? And this is not like a gastropub with 'ambiance' or anything. It would be much less painful if the service was a lot, lot better. Even with the high prices and some other issues, the food is good enough to cause cravings and keep bringing me back, I just wish they would work out the kinks.

Everyone in my party got the burger special which was $4.95 burgers with fries and $1 topping. One person's order got messed up, it was 'well done' when he asked for 'medium.' It was also missing a topping. Then it came back out like 2 minutes later with the topping on there so we assume that they sent out the same 'well done' burger. This was notified to the waitress and she comped the burger. The other burgers were almost all there, cooked as ordered but still, everyone said it was kind of dry. My sister sa",3

Once we arrived at the restaurant we were informed that there would be an hour wait which seemed a little confusing because there were lots of empty tables and this added to the all-around disgruntled feeing of the group but we decided to wait it out. The hostess staff at this particular location is not very pleasant but once we were seated our waitress was very nice. The wait was only 20 minutes or so. For the eight of us we ordered two large pizzas, one pepperoni and one sausage, and an appetizer sampler filled with an assortment of deep friend things.

"Epic burger is like (insert name of the first restaurant you think of with thinner, griddle made patties) with better ingredients basically. Good Bacon. Nice, soft bun. Great fries (until they get cold, but really, when isn't that the case?). Unfortunately, the burger itself fell short compared to my expectations. It was ok - first I'll qualify this by saying that I'm not a big 'thin' burger fan. If I wanted that, I could end up getting it for a whole lot cheaper at a place like Culvers (2 Burgers + Extra Toppings + Fries + 1 Drink = $26 at Epic). For that amount, I could have sat down at a restaurant and ordered my burger between rare and medium rare. (Note: I'll assume the risk of undercooked beef; I just want it to taste good).

"really, three and a half stars. after all, chicago pizza is never just a-ok. the low rating here is because of the atmosphere. it's hardly authentic, and looks more like an applebee's than a traditional chicago pizza parlor. but after forty minutes of feeling displaced, the pizza arrives, and you lose yourself in the aroma, the cheese, the tomato, the crust, ooooooh. i've been to more authentic giordano's [worth four stars], but still prefer uno, due and gino's east to the chain.",3

Took about 45 minutes to get our special small sized deep dish pizza.. Lots of mozzarella and less meaty.  Fried zucchini was heavenly.  Would suggest the appetizer platter if you are a big group.  Tried their pizza and got out with their Tshirt as a souvenir :-)",3
"I would have previously given this location 5 stars.. but I had a bad experience on my most recent trip :( I love Deep Dish Pizza, and I Love Giordanos Deep Dish Pizza.. However I've discovered that I HATE the lunchtime small 'baby' pizza.   After trying a different pizza place my first day I was excited to end my trip with a great pie... however the person I was with didn't want Peperoni so I was worried I wouldn't get the full experience.. Then when we saw the personal sized pizzas I thought i'd found my saving grace.. Little did I know it would be cold.   Never order the lunchtime special.. Just get a small and wait the time for it to bake, it's tons better!",3
"I mean, it's just not my thing.  I'm used to dive bars and jukeboxes.  The place was nice and small and very chic.  ALOT of business people too.  They have a martini menu and I ordered the pomegranate one.  It was very good.  Tried the chicken pizza too, that was good.  I came here for a mixer, the atmosphere was nice and I liked the lighting.  The martini was $10.   It seems like a good place to meet after work if you work downtown but it was kind of trek for me so I may not be coming too far into downtown to have another martini.",3
"I debated with myself over giving Epic 3 or 4 stars. In the end, I won the debate (I know, I'm as surprised as you are) and went with 3. Getting the trivialities out of the way first: The space is pretty nice. Clean, modern, warm. Like an upscale fast food place. Which is what Epic Burger is. They built the place expecting long lines. You can basically have a line from the front door to the counter (way in back, and it's a deep space) without interfering with anything or annoying the patrons dining in the restaurant. Unfortunately you can't see the menu until you get up near the counter, so you can't use your time waiting in line (I went in a bit early and didn't have to wait) to study the menu and decide what you want. Fortunately, the menu is small and doesn't take long to study when you",3

"This is my second review in as many days. Since their deep dish pizza made me a believer, I couldn't resist trying their ribs. Actually I had their BBQ ribs and chicken wing combo with waffle fries. Years ago I had ribs from Carsons and I was disappointed because they were not fall off the bone. Well the ribs at Exchequer did not disappoint. The ribs were fall off the bone. And although the BBQ sauce was tasty, I have had better ribs before at Smokey Joes in Aruba.  Still they were much better than Carsons. Now for the wings. They were dry wings, not buffalo like I am used to with a side of blue cheese.  These slightly larger than usual wings came with a side dish of the same BBQ sauce as the ribs. Come to think of it, it's probably better then mixing with blue cheese, but by the end of my",4

"Was visiting a friend in Chicago and she insisted we had to go to Giordano's. I love deep dish so I was all for it. We called ahead and said we'd pick up because it's usually crazy busy. We arrived about 20 minutes later and the place was packed! People waiting in line, people at the bar, people waiting to be seated. This place must be great. It took about 15 extra minutes (only complaint) but we finally got our extra large, deep dish, cheese with green peppers pizza. It smelt and tasted absolutely decadent. Everything fit together perfectly and I'd go back there in a heart beat. If they don't serve this is Heaven, I'm not going.",4

Pretty good, nothing like you'd get in Philly probably.  I get the chicken philly sometimes to make me feel a little less guilty.  the fresh cut fries are tasty, and normally fried right (not overly greasy).",4
"I  thought I would give Epic a try, I work just down the block.  A bunch of my co-workers and I checked it out.  I ordered a Portebello burger for $5.99.  Huge mushroom on a Delicious whole wheat bun, good Epic special sauce, normal burger fix ins and add Wisconsin cheddar for .89.  a bag of hand cut fries is $2 but is huge and can easily be shared.   I loved my burger, very tasty.  Fries were good too. All meats are naturally raised and they seemed to care about the environment (disposable silverware that was corn based and bio degradable ) but the recycling can was no where to be found..hmmm Over all my co-workers and I enjoyed our burgers and they were Epic in proportion.  I will go back and split a burger and fries!",4

We got it. Puit in the oven.  Cut the Pie.  Opened mouth.  Insert Pie.

For our meal we had the 'mexican scramble' and the signature french toast.  Both were excellent.  One of the best egg dishes I have ever tasted for sure; cheesy, a little spicy, perfectly cooked.  Only had a couple bites of my girlfriend's french toast, but it was delicious as well, and she gave",4

The most popular Deep Dish pizzas can be found at either at Gino's East or Pizza Uno (according to recommendations)... At the last minute, our friend who lives in Chi-Town demanded that we go to Giordano's because they are the underdog of deep dish and truly have the best pie.

It's amazing because you wouldn't expect anyone to improve upon or make special the boring but delicious treat that is cheese popcorn, but they have succeeded. It's so good, you don't mind that your hands turn orange. The Chicago Mix: they put both flavors together and shake it up in one bag. It doesn't sound good, but it's amazing. The flavors complement each other perfectly. It's a perfect sweet and salty combo. I wish it was a little cheaper. Six bucks is a lot for a little bag of popcorn, but it's so good that I'm willing to pay it. The quality of the product also means you have to wait in line for at least twenty minutes, but I don't see any way around that.",5

I spotted Jimmy Green's on south State St., took a 5-second look around, liked what I saw, and snatched a menu. I read the menu on the L and was impressed with the food options. It seemed like some effort was being made to provide interesting food for reasonable prices (as in a near-downtown value). So, it was the first place that came to mind for the party. After some e-mailing, a reservation was made. I got there a couple of hours early and Jeff was very accommodating to change the seating plan to fit my needs. I had asked for a booth, but there wasn't one large enough to allow my entire party to see the main screen e",4

The service for the most part was great, except for that one time our server seemed to hover a little too much. No big, though. The food and atmosphere are both pretty fun, and there are plenty of TV's to keep the sport fans entertained. Very fun spot, I am definitely going back and would recommend that you do too!",4
"The good: Decent beer selection Specials Above average pub food (hence a little more expensive) The bartender has always been great. The bad: Sometimes it's ridiculously loud (just in the bar area, so who's REALLY complaining). There's no dedicated/noticeable host, so if you want to sit in the more secluded dining area in a back, it can be a confusing, 'where should I go' moment.

Well, that all changed with each course that came out of this quaint Italian restaurant. From the Italian bread with the olive oil and Parmesan cheese, to our appetizers of carpacchio and mussels, we were off to a good start.  Our martinis were perfectly poured which made the decision to order a bottle of wine just that much harder.

(4 hungry people)!.   But my biggest regret was ordering the friend appetizers which just about killed my appetite before the pizza arrived, and in retrospect so much  more bland than the pizza that I wish I didn't order it at all.   The deep dish crust is amazing, I wish they would sell that alone and I would eat it plain.",4

The kind of really disappointing fries. They were really hot when we got them, and then they quickly cooled off into a soggy mess.  The taste was something to be desired as well.  We got two orders, but when the fries arrived, we could have easily shared one order.

I was really surprised by the crust, it seemed more like a crumbly pastry to me but I really really liked it. A little too much cheese for my taste but eh, how often will I really eat authentic Chicago deep dish pizza? There was a large group of us (14) and we were accommodated well and in good time. After we all finished we walked [very] leisurely back to the hotel and passed out in our own individual food comas. We all had leftovers but those brave enough to eat theirs were still satisfied with the taste though the crust had lost a bit of its magic. All in all, I'd say t",4

The last time we went, they were making fresh kreplach from scratch, so the Ju Pu Platter (which I ordered), took a bit longer than everyone else's food.  I couldn't have cared less, I was enjoying the company I was with and was in no hurry, and since they said it was taking longer because they were making fresh kreplach, I was happy with that.  But then they even gave me a bowl of homemade chicken noodle ",4

New being the contemporary chandeliers, the curved staircases at each end and the escalator up to the 2nd floor. The hotel takes up only the first 15 floors of the building with offices making up the remainder. In the lobby is the 'lobby bar'. Large with comfy seating areas and a fireplace. While the drink list is extensive, the menu was equally interesting given it is on a back lit device that they plug in each night to recharge so you can see the menu even in the darkest corners of the bar. Service was stellar and friendly. The roo",5
"Great phos for a random Korean place in the loop, though its doused with MSG, I was pretty thirsty afterwards",4
"This was my first time in Chicago, so OF COURSE I had to try deep dish. I'd asked a bunch of Chicago-ans about their favorite places to eat earlier and had sparked an INTENSE debate about which pizza place was best, but this place seemed to have the most votes. I actually stumbled here on accident after touring Northwestern Law, but I'm glad I did! It was just me, so I ordered an individual sausage deep dish and added some spinach (about 7 or 8 bucks IIRC). It was INTENSE. Soooo delicious. I am a BIG fan of cheese and I loved that when they served it, it was all still melty and stretchy and stringy, and the spinach and sausage were plentiful enough that I didn't feel cheated. My favorite part, however, was the crust. It wasn't hard or anything--it was delicious, almost sort of flaky, soft ",4
"yum. I'm obsessed with stuffed spinach pizza from giordanos. I think I'm going to order some right now!! Its a place you must eat at when visiting Chicago.",5
"Recent visit to Chicago, stopped in to grab a bag. As soon as you walk close to the location you smell the delicious scent! As soon as i made it back to my hotel room i popped open the bag. My review: Its good! There's no denying that, but it's not 'Go out of my way, order online, ask someone in Chicago to bring me a bag back... ' Nope not that good.  However, if/when I'm in Chicago I'll make sure i pick up a bag. I have only tried the Chicago mix & i dont' wanna try anything else. Im addicted to that one. The downtown location had a crazy line, thankfully it moved quickly. Not sure why they wouldnt have more than one person at the register on a busy Saturday/holiday weekend?? I also stopped by the Navy Pier location for a sample and there were maybe 3 ppl ahead of me. I would go back to t",4
"My friend and I ordered calamari for starters then a10-inch pepperoni and sausage-stuffed deep dish cheese pizza at this spot. Both were presented in generous portions! The calamari was delectably crispy while the deep dish had extremely tasty and thick mozzarella. At first, a ten-inch diameter for a pizza seems just enough for two .. but with this chicago deep dish, it is definitely more than enough! There is a 30-min wait for the pizza to be served but with food this good, it is well worth the wait!",4
"Exchequer is pretty darn good.  The pepperoni pizza is my favorite!  The pepperoni must have been sent from the angel of cured meat; it's just the way that pepperoni was meant to taste. Just divey enough to fit in with the area, but not so divey that you're scared to order food.    Plus, the staff is fantastic.  I definitely recommend giving it a try. Oh and it's a great location for events. I hosted an event for about 30 people there, and it was a perfect space for socializing.",4
"I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza but I consider Giordano's to be the best. Their filling is mozzarella stringy-gooey without being oily and the crust is more like a real pie crust (flakey and doughey) unlike the greasy spongy focaccia-like crust typical of other deep dish pizzas. This Chicago chain can get super crowded so it might be better to order in (which is what we did after balking at the wait at another Giordano's location).",4
"Being a deep dish virgin, this type of pizza is 100% the bomb . com and I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to thin pizza!  After debating for a few minutes on Giordano's and Geno's East with the locals at Lizze McNeill's, we finally decided on Giordano's simply because they delivered.  My friend from Chi-town informed me with deep dish, it's all about the crust and the sauce on the pizza. I learned there's savory crust and even sweet crust, that has the taste/consistency of cornbread (which just seems weird to me).  I'm upset I never had a conversation with my friend's dad since he's supposedly a deep dish snob/conoisseur. We had Giordano's delivered to Lizze McNeill's in the loop for my last Chi-town dinner.  It was simply too cold to leave the bar.  I was aware this would take at",5
"I really like the food at Emerald Loop. Every time I have come in, I have ordered something different and have been quite happy. I am a big fan of the mac & cheese and my new favorite - the summertime salad! While I do enjoy the food, I have never had good service there. It is always very slow. TIP: If you are going to a Chicago Theater show the same day, show them your ticket stub and you get one free appetizer per table. That's a nice perk!",4
"I was visiting a friend who lives in Chicago and we, with our other friends, went to Giordano's for an early dinner. My stomach can't handle heavy food, but theirs could so I was lame and ordered garlic bread and a Greek salad while the rest of them ordered a deep dish cheese pizza. When our food arrived, the waitress put the salad in the middle of table, assuming that we were going to be eating it before the pizza, but alas, I told her, in a defeated voice, that it was my meal and she looked surprised. I guess people don't exactly go there for salads. The Greek salad was....a Greek salad. It came with anchovies, which I love and was decent. The garlic bread came with marinara sauce and was not all that garlicky.  As soon as my friends got their pizza, they dove in. I bravely tried a small",4
"This place is right around the corner from my office so I eat here a lot. The burgers are so good it hurts, literally. I have to take away a star for the epic amount of time I spend in the lavatory after I eat here. The fact that I keep going back is a testament to how good the food really is. This is easily a five star burger with amazing ingredients(especially the egg). The fries aren't so great, but you don't really need any with a burger of these proportions.",4
"I love this place, it's atmosphere is fun yet quaint at the same time.  I have been here three times and have ordered the same meal each time - because it was so incredible.  I gave it 4 stars because, well 5 starts is a pretty serious thing, and I need to mix it up a bit and try more of their food before giving a 5 star. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try the next delectable dish.",4
"Food: Very good deep dish pizza. As others have said, it will take 30-45 mins before your food comes out. It is a very cheesy pizza and I would even suggest telling the waiter to go light on the cheese. It really makes no sense that there is so much cheese on a pizza. Kind of a turn off honestly. The crust is nice and doughy yet flakey. Very filling pizza. Even 'real men' would eat it with a fork/knife. If you are in a party of two please get the size lower than medium. I would assume that is a small. There is no way in the world that two people (man + woman) can finish a medium pizza. Too much food. All of that cheese doesn't help either. If you can, call in advance to place your order so you won't be sitting at your table for ever. Workers: No complaints. Atmosphere: Default. Overall: If",4
"Came here on a Sunday evening with our two kids and had a lovely meal!  It was my daughter's fourth bday, so she really enjoyed the strawberry shake and kids chicken dinner she ordered.  I loved my french dip, and my husband really liked 'The Springer' and cheese fries.  We will be back!!!!",5
"Another fine food establishment for the South Loop!!!",4
"Very good cheap eats in downtown Chicago - great place to go for lunch if you work in 'the loop'.  Stopped in again recently, and it's the same today as it was a decade ago - I guess if you're in business this long, you must be doing something right.",4
"This is definitely a great spot to watch a game.  My husband and I went there to have dinner, grab a few beers and watch the game.  We really liked this place because there were tv's everywhere- we can literally watch the game from every angle.  Although we sat at a table, it was very cool to see that each booth had its very own tv as well. The food was pretty good and they had a wide selection of beer.  The ambiance was fun and energetic; and the music was great.  In addition, the service was attentive. Last but not least, I really like that there is ample parking (pay for parking on the street, or $6 dollar parking lot around the corner). Going back soon!",4
"Great! Wasn't super busy when we arrived so food arrived fast. Staff was very attentive and helpful as we aren't local. As mentioned they serve breakfast all day and boast a typical Jewish family dining feel. We weren't familiar with what that meant but we were impressed and I will look for others elsewhere! Food was delicious, I would recommend the eggs and hash and French toast! The desserts look fabulous however the carrot cake was not anything special.",4
"YUMMY deep dish pizza! Love that you can order while you wait for a table... service was on spot, but lacked personal touch...but whatever, I don't care about that.  I don't want to be friends with my waiter.  I just want a good damn pizza...which is what I got!",5
"All I have to say is this is the best pizza I have ever had in my life!! I'm from California and the 'chicago' style pizza they have there is a disappointment now that I tasted Giordano's. If only one of them can open a location up in Cali. I have to live with Patxi's and Zachary's which are just sad. The thing you must do though is make sure to order ahead or you'll be stuck for a very very long time.",5
"My friend and I came here to try their World Famous Deep Dish Pizza so we shared a small Chicago Stuffed Spinach Pizza with Mushrooms. Who knew a small pizza would take 40 minutes to cook?! Anyway, it was worth the wait... it was so good. WAY BETTER THAN NY STYLE THIN PIZZAS! And, I have to say that I actually liked this place better than Pizzeria Uno and Gino's East.  And their crust.... oh emm gee! Makes me not want to order any pizza from Cali after tasting this!  Oh, and it was great paired with their local Goose Island 312 Urban Wheat Ale! :)",5
"Even when I felt like I was on death's door, I found my first experience to Gioco to be wonderful. We had great service from Marcello and friendly interactions with everyone else. The menu was amazing; many options spoke to me but I managed to restrain myself and order just one entree...After a glass of wine and sharing the Caprese appetizer (which had amazing olive oil on it) I ate as much of the Prosciutto pizza I ordered as possible. Never one to pass up dessert if I have room, I sampled the chocolate cake on Marcello's recommendation for something good to share. It was warm and delicious. Everything was very good and reminded me of being in a restaurant on Bologna! The place is seriously charming! And the South Loop locale is great; very close to the Brown Line.",5
"This location is a hidden gem in the windy city. We were walking around the city and decided to have pizza. We called ahead to the other location near the Sears Tower and they said they didn't take reservations so we called this one up and they took our pizza order and by the time we walked over, the pizza was ready and we were served. It was sooo good. One slice goes a long way!",5
"If you visit Chicago, you must stop at Garrett. Be warned, once you start eating their famed Chicago mix (cheese/caramel), you will not stop. They pop it fresh daily and it will stay fresh for at least 3 days after your purchase, but it will probably not last that long. The portions they give are also very good for the price. A small (a little over $4) is typically large enough for 2 people to share with a little left over. I have not had to purchase anything larger than a medium (a little over $6) for a family of 4. They are centrally located all over Chicago (and in the O'Hare airport). They also allow online ordering, but it can get steep depending on the size you need. DO NOT check this on your way home if you want it to arrive at your destination. Note they won't tape or staple the ba",5
"Best in chi town",5
"It's Garrett's.  I don't even like popcorn, but I love this stuff.",5
"Being from California, our definition of Pizza is Pizza Hut, Round Table, etc etc.  After going to Chicago and going to Giordano's, I have a whole new appreciation for Pizza, especially Deep Dish Pizza.  It was by far the best pizza I've ever had.  Expect the place to be PACKED whenever you go, so there is going to be a wait, but it def. is worth the wait.  The aroma of the place is enough to keep you around.  Service was outstanding.  All around good experience...def go if you're in the Chicago area",5
"The Best Stuffed Pizza in Chicago. It just is. Gino's, Uno and Due, Lou Malnati's? Please. You guys 'coulda been a contender', but ended up being mere pretenders to the title.   Giordano's wins. Can be slow, of course it takes a long time to bake the deep-dish pizzas, but the service itself is also sometimes slow. Giordano's is a fairly large chain of restaurants with about 40 locations in the greater metropolitan area, and some other places as well.   So it's somewhat formulaic, if you have seen one then basically you have seen them all. However the uniform quality also means that you know in advance that it's going to be really good.",5
"Ahhhh....This is my favorite pizza in the whole wide world. I go to a lot of Giordanos (including this one, Midway airport location and Franklin & Randolph) but have been to this one the most. The stuffed sausage is my favorite along with the stuffed Spinach also. Their thin crust pizza is pretty good as well. They have a bar if you are interested in having a drink.During lunch you can get a personal pizza to go which is always great if you are in a hurry, but you can't get it after 5PM. T This place always hits the spot and will always have the best pizza in Chicago! Mmmm Mmmm Good!",5

Oh, and when asparagus is in season they have a special sandwich with it. One word to describe this place : Totallyfreakingdelicious",5

"Eleven City is one damned charming restaurant. Hold onto your pants as you enter lest they be charmed right off your body. The unusual mix of antiques, vintage-inspired design, and Judaica somehow pull together and work as a unique decor. I was in the neighborhood, walking from one industry event to another about four blocks away, when I realized I was starving. Eleven City was rated much higher than the other local eatery I could see from where I was standing, but...a diner? Hmmm.... I made the right decision! As soon as I came in, two different staff members said hi to me. When I was seated, I was offered reading material since I was dining alone. I hadn't heard of a phosphate, but when the barmaid explained them to me, I knew I wanted one. Delicious! I had the cherry flavor and have a f",5
"Love love love. The 'old school' feeling when you are there is unbeatable.. they do have great service too. One day the manager was literally seating customers. That says alot. I do not, however, like the prices. I do think its a little bit steep.. HOWEVER... the food is better than regular diner-food. So... all in all... definitely worth going and grabbing a milkshake and burger :)",5
"good",5
"Surrounded by chain restaurants, this place holds its own, despite no longer being able to make sandwiches (wraps-only these days).  If you're looking for a sandwich, however (the California Club is delicious), just hop over to the outpost across the street on the first floor of the Smurfit Stone building.",5

I had roast beef and cheddar and it was EXCELLENT, my bud had some other sandwich....plus a bag of chips and two rootbeers for $20.95. Great meal and comfortable place to have a chat!",5
"This place is impeccable. From the service to the food to the atmosphere. We were sat right away and the gentlemen took our coats. The host and waitress were attentive and super friendly, even though the place was crowded. We were in the process of sitting down and they were bringing bread and drinks already. Server had many suggestions, asking if we had any allergies she should know about. The flat bread pizza was delicious as well as our pasta dishes. I would rec commend this place to everyone.",5
"Hands Down the best deep dish pizza the world has to offer.  I was introduced to deep dish back in 1992 by my cousins there and been back numerous times and tried them all from Uno's, Gino's East, Lou Malnatis', Pequod's , Pizano's, to know Giordano's wins my Award for the best .  Giordano's simply takes pride in their crust, ingredients, and sauce-Not bready crap like everywhere else. But watch out don't burn the crap out of the top part of your mouth.",5
"I love popcorn and have been craving this since I first had a taste of Garrett's popcorn.  I usually just stick with the cheese and caramel one. Unfortunately, this place closes a little early for me. I think around 8pm. I flew into Chicago for Business and we couldn't find a Garret's....we just decided to chow down to a good dinner. Fortunately there's a Garrett's inside ORD at the United terminal. I grabbed a couple of bags and the popcorn was good for a couple of days. yummy!!!",5
"We couldn't come to Chicago without having Chicago style stuffed pizza, now could we?  Who cares if it takes forever for the pizza to show up on your table (takes 30-40 minutes to cook I guess), it's DELICIOUS.  There is a nice courtyard type area right in front with a fountain feature, which came quite in handy while we tried to entertain our 12.5 month old son during the wait.  The crust makes the pizza!   p.s.  that's our little guy on my avatar at this Giordano's location.  He loved it, too!",5
"Wow, bombalicious pizza, man! That's how I remember the Giordano's pie. The pizza is super thick, and baked tall like cheesecake. Layers and layers, like lasagna baby! I've tried pizza in: Italy...super thin, crackerlike crust Da Left Coast...hate it Regularly now in New York City...average pizza joint has 'bout 1/2 inch or so crust But the hype I heard iz Giordano's is da bomb for Chicago T-H-I-C-K style pizza...yo, belee da hype Yo, if this joint were to plop a shop in Manhattan or just about anywhere else in New York City, it'd be instant success! Gimme a shout out, if any of y'all know a pizza joint like Giordano's in New York City.",5
"I was shocked to see the mediocre reviews of Epic Burger.  Some friends and I stopped by Epic Burger on Friday night and everyone was RAVING about the food!  I had the Epic Burger Combo.  I love, love, love hand-cut fries and Epic Burger's did not disappoint.  Plus, there were plenty of them.   The burger itself was wonderful!  It had the uneven, slightly crispy edges that reminded me of a Steak 'n Shake steakburger.  Ordinarily, I shy away from 'special sauces' on a hamburger, but, for whatever reason, I decided to go with the sauce and I'm sure glad I did!  I got the egg bun.  Several of us were raving at how great the egg buns were.",5
"Free icecream and friendly service, a wonderful surprise and a great place for lunch with the coworkers!",5
"Berry Fufilling- its true! I had this smoothie for breakfast, and I didn't want to eat lunch. I tried to go with a selection low in calories and lower in sugar than the rest, and this was the winner. I loved it! The only problem was they were out of raspberries, and so they used extra strawberries and blueberries. I didn't mind, but that's just a warning to anyone who is a raspberry fanatic. Hopefully it doesn't happen very often.  My friend was shocked when he found out I had never been to Jamba Juice. Now I can see why. I waited way to long! I may be a Jamba Juice regular now.",5
"This is now my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. Amazing dishes in all categories. Try the mushroom pizza, the oxtail gnocchi. Great wines also.",5
"French food on the 40th floor. This place is amazing! From the exquisite decor and wonderful view to the mouth-watering food. I had their seven-course set meal here and every course was fantastic. But I'd have to say they really did save the best for last -- the dessert was five different, absolutely tasty desserts decorated on one plate.  This place was definitely really expensive but worth every penny! Make sure you make reservations beforehand and request a seat by the window -- you don't want to miss this spectacular view of the city.",5
"On this visit, I was asked if I've ever rated a Giordano's less than 5 stars.  The answer is no. Even though the pizza was light on sausage and mushroom, it was delicious, flaky, doughy, cheesy goodness.  My stomach is growling for my last leftover slice right now, and it is 7:26am.  Don't judge me. I had never been to this location before and anticipated it to be less crowded than the original or any other Chicago location, but I was wrong!  There was a constant line and groups waiting outside on Friday night.  And for good reason! Vote for Giordano's!  You won't be disappointed. P.S.  It's awesome that you can pre-order your pizza as you wait.",5

I absolutely loved it. The staff was nice and organized. Prices were reasonable, and the wait really wasn't so bad, especially because it was Lollapolooza weekend. I have eaten at Pizzeria Uno here in San Diego which sells deep dish pizza and I actually like their crust better, its so buttery flakey...so I'm at least happy we have that place on the west coast as well.",5

I was soooo good! I am so going here again!",5
"Man, this place knows how to rock the deep dish pizza.  I discovered some reviews on yelp, and since then it's been in the lunch rotation.  It takes a while to make-and count on it taking the full 45 minutes-but they remind you about this when you order, and you can always call them ahead of time so your pizza will be ready when you arrive.  I'd never ventured further than their pizza until our office had one of our retirement parties there.  Oh man.  For a little over twenty bucks we had pop, beer, and wine for drinks.  Our package included ceasar salad, chicken, beef kabob, potatoes, and on and on.  So tasty.  What really impressed me was they kept refilling everything, even when it seemed like everyone was winding down.  Oh, and when we were done, they brought out a bunch of to go boxes",5

Nothing compares to walking blocks on a cold winter night and swooping in the revolving door with a blast of warm air and the delicious aroma of pizza. If you hate long waits, call in and order ahead of time or preorder and head to the bar. It takes nearly a half-hour to make your pizza if you're ordering a deep dish, never mind the long wait for a table. But it will all be worth it the minute you take that first cheesy bite.

"Great little grease factory in the south loop, just  a block and half away from the Harold Washington branch of the Chicago Public Library. Actually a decent value, I've paid more for a burger and fries in the suburbs. Fantastic mozzarella sticks too. The inside is small, maybe 9-10 tables and a 3-4 person bar. In the summer they set up a few outdoor tables. If you come during normal lunch times be prepared to get creative in your eating location.",5
"The food here is awesome. The drinks are awesome. The staff is awesome. Lunch is not too pricey considering it is the Loop and the portions are HUGE. They give you the option to split with some one at the table too whereas some places down there scoff at the idea. After work drinks or dinner is fun and fantastic. I love the staff. If you love a good martini ask Lucy for her Dirty - you will not be disappointed!",5

If you see the long lines, jus make sure you go ahead and have your money ready, and stay off your cell phone, they won't work with you if you are on the phone! It's worth the stay in line.

"Is Gold Coast Dogs a pleasant place to spend an afternoon?  No, you're either looking out at a parking garage on the north or a gritty section of Wabash under the L tracks on the west, from inside a bare bones room with fading formica tables and a long window counter.  But man, the dogs are freakin' great!  From time to time I get the craving for a char dog, lightly crispy on the splayed ends, sitting inside an authentic Rosen's poppyseed bun with all the required fixin's.  Add a nice little bag of french fries, which were hot and pleasantly potato-ey in flavor (though they could have been a little crispier to my taste) and a cup of Coke and....well, I'm just a happy guy.  The dog flingers are friendly and efficient at what they do.  And while I was there, a guy was constantly wiping down ",4
"What a Great Place to Eat!!!  We found this place by accident and came back several times during out stay in Chicago.  Everything we ordered was very good, service was excellent and you can get meals to go.  Don't miss the cheesecake!!! ....  and they have Dr Brown's!!",4

"Of all the Jimmy John's locations I've been to, this is probably my favorite.  The staff here is very friendly and personable, very fast and always making sure that things are clean and orderly.  Their sandwich construction is tops (sandwich construction is very important to me).  The price here is pretty middle-of-the-road compared to other locations in the area (I mean we're only talking a difference of like 30 cents, but still).  My only gripe is that they don't have yellow/banana peppers.",5

Strawberry Nirvana with an immunity boost, and a burner boost to get the metabolism rockin' in the morning . . . can we say GO?",5
"I have been to this place many many times. The service here is always great and the food is always tasty and good. The fish and chips here have got t be the absolutely best I have ever tasted and I have tasted fish and chips from many many places. The fish seems to be baked?? Maybe slightly fried??... I am not sure.. But it is not oily, it is crunchy, it is fresh and a nice chunky piece of cod. It comes with perfectly cooked peas.. Absolutely perfectly cooked.... I don't know how they do it, but they make it perfect every time. It is crunchy, but fully cooked. Kudos to Emerald loop!",5
"I really have wanted to try many things on the menu, but I can't. I always get the Madison and can't stray. The wraps look great, but this sandwich is perfection on bread. I always get the guacamole and chips with it instead of the normal side, which is so worth it for an extra dollar. Very generous portions too. I've convinced my work to cater from this place and we're addicted. I'd would eat here everyday if I could afford to eat out that much!",5

"If this review ends abruptly, it's because I fell asleep after eating their wonderful turkey sandwich. They have REAL freshly made turkey sandwiches (they bake and hand carve Turkeys daily).. You can pick white or dark meat, or both.  You can pick to put it on a roll, bagel, sub, etc.  You can pick from a number of toppings (I go for the very messy dijon, mayo, cranberry, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato combination).. They have a $6+tax turkey sandwich+drink+chips.  I always get a sandwich, chips, and banana instead. Hard to beat this deal! They also have falafel and skewers but I've never tried",4
"Although I missed my lunch partner, the stars finally aligned for Goodwin's and me! Tip: go down the incognito North door, not the South one; there you'll go deep below the Earth's crust like Persephone being lured by Pluto's promises of fresh ingredients made into salads, sandwiches, soups, and signature wraps! Okay, you may actually get held up waiting in the stairwell on your descent if you go during prime lunch time, because this place is very popular. But the wait will give you time to look at their menu and equivocate over 2-3 wraps or sandwiches like I did. I had my choice all made until I got closer to ordering and then saw the Specials chalk board. The soup was Spring Asparagus, so I called an Audible and got the 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup deal! My sandwich was the Sausalito, wh",4
"This was the best pizza experience I have ever had (Seniore's in San Francisco is a close second). Although the wait is a bit long because they make your pizza to order, when it came out I could feel the floodgates open in my salivary gland. The wait for the pizza was roughly half an hour, so budget time if necessary. We ordered the famous special pizza and I will attempt to describe my thought process as best as possible. Pizza coming out: 'Ooh this looks tasty. It's about 1 inch in thickness. Massive pizza.' I was severly underwhelmed at Lou Malnati's so this looked promising. Waitress cutting the pizza: 'Wow that is some stringy cheese. The tomato sauce layer on the top was sure decieving... there's an entire layer of cheese, sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc between the crust and the top",5
"Thank God for the Midwest...and Italians. ;)  Only here would this sort of pizza chain have the appetite to down slice after slice of the stuffed goodness known as Giardano's world-famous.  (In LA, for example, people would be more likely to vomit afterward--not necessarily due to bulimia, but because their bodies aren't used to being abused by the elements and self-indulgence like here.  And frankly, the value for sinly delecacies is not the same...so I digress.)My favorite/standard pick is the Special with garlic (extra), not to outshine, however, the 3-cheese or even the shrimp (albeit an unusual experience the first go around).  Whatever your pleasure--pizza, pasta or otherwise, Giardano's is a rare American treat.I will certainly be back.  Hope you come to your senses too. ;)",5
"Giordano's Pizza is the cheesiest pizza I've had since Bacino's and it is the only place where I will eat stuffed pizza. It's original and delicious. It's also good in the price range, so I can go there often. The stuffed pizza, if you don't know, has the sauce on top of the cheese. You have to go there to get the idea, but the pizza is perfect.",5

When we go I always order the Springer on Challah (they won't tell us who makes their fabulous Challah bread!) and it is always terrific. This is a great place for hangover food or if you're looking for an ambient piece of old Chicago. Terrific pickle and green tomato plate as well.",5
"Wow.  This was really fun. On Rosh Hashana eve, when good Jews like us should be at the Synagogue, we went into the city to visit our daughter and take her out to dinner.  She works up at Water Tower Place and goes to college in the south Loop, so she took the El down to meet us, and we walked over to Eleven City Diner. The diner has been there about four years, although I have to admit I'd not heard of it before.  They set it up to look like a New York Deli, sort of like the Carnegie Deli, although it is much more spacious.  In fact, they compare themselves to the Carnegie. When we arrived, my wife mentioned we were there to celebrate Rosh Hashana.  The waiter immediately took us to a reserved table with white linens on it.   They had several of these set up around the place just for that",5
"I'm hard pressed to find a good deli sandwich outside of the East Coast, but Jersey Mike's nails it.  I got a mini and it was huge.  The folks here are super nice and the price is great.  Whatever you get, be sure to get it Mike's Way (but watch out for those onions!)",4
"Had lunch here on a Friday at 11:30...there were only a few people in line when we arrived, but as we left at 12:15 pm it was PACKED and the line went up the stairs. I had roast beef and cheddar and it was EXCELLENT, my bud had some other sandwich....plus a bag of chips and two rootbeers for $20.95. Great meal and comfortable place to have a chat!",5
"This pizza place is certainly one of the greatest of Chicago. The place is well located, the menu and the variety of the pizzas are very good and the stuffed Pizza is amazing.Another good thing is that you can pick the toppings that you want and if you want to eat different pizzas every time you can !I went there with my family and after that with my girlfriend, and in both occasions we had delicious food with great treatment, so I recommend !",5
"You know when you're in a bad mood or had a crappy day and you just need to find your 'happy place'? That is Eleven City Diner for me. I fell seriously in love with this place, pretty much before I even walked in the doors. After hearing that they have excellent Jewish diner food I checked out their website/menu and I was sold. When my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate Valentine's Day I said, 'I want to get a reuben sandwich at Eleven City Diner'...that's just the kind of girl I am. Ever since that evening I have come back multiple times bringing everyone with me (including out of towners and my family in from the burbs). As soon as you walk into the place you can't help but smile. It feels like a retro diner with random Jewish items all around like paintings of rabbis an",5

"I have always been a fan of Giordano's  and this review is NOT for their pizza, because it is always delicious, but it's for the treatment that we had. I ate here with a business convention group of about 10 people. It was in the middle of the day at around 2pm and honestly, we could not get our waiters attention even if we searched and asked around. We had two extra guests come and they were waiting for 20 minutes for the waiter to notice and bring extra chairs and plates. The thing is, they were not even busy so it doesn't make sense why it took another 20 minutes for our water to come. Maybe this location is not good or just this waiter, but it was just unacceptable service. but don't get me wrong, the pizza is always amazing, this review is solely for the service.",1

"I had been to Emerald a couple of times and thought it was a typical, mediocre downtown bar that would be universally loved (as all Irish bars are). I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice! After another attempt to order a drink it w",1
"I was completely disappointed when I recently visited Giordano's to have some deep dish pizza.  I had never been during my four-year tenure in Chicago, but visited on business since I couldn't get up to Art of Pizza on Ashland Ave.  I brought a colleague of mine to enjoy authentic Chicago deep dish and I was so embarrassed.  It was awful, the service was mediocre.  Do yourself a favor and go to Art of Pizza on Ashland Ave (not far from Wrigley Field) - it's Zagat Rated and you don't have to buy a whole pizza, you can buy deep dish by the slice.  It's amazing, worth the ride!",1
"I was so excited for Eggy's. A diner within walking distance from my place. My daughter had gone and said it was wonderful. Well, fast forward to my visit. They changed the menu! Absolutely no original dishes. All I read about was their Benedict. Off the menu. We ordered their seasonal pancakes, multi berry. It was just a plain pancake, and moments later they brought to the table a dish with thawed frozen berries to pour over the plain pancake. That is terrible. Never again. Eggy's, why would you change a menu when the menu reviews were so positive? It's a shame.",1

Several of my coworkers and I were working late at my office and we decided to get Giordano's delivered.  I called in and talked to a woman who REALLY hurriedly took my order.  I ordered a large stuffed pizza, gave her my credit card info, and then she very quickly said 'It will be an hour' before hanging up the phone before I could cancel. We figured it was ok, so waited the hour and the delivery guy was right on time.  Unfortunately, he brought a large thin crust pizza (we ordered stuffed).  I called in and the woman paused for a moment (probably realizing that it was almost time for them to go home) and then told me 'no, that's not what you order",1

"I have been to JW twice and each time the service and food left me feeling blue after it was all said and done. Our server said to sit anywhere we like. Ok...does that mean once we are seated if we are not in an area that has a server assigned that we are left to go back and make the food ourselves? We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again. We sat in whats considered the 'Bar' area and not the booths. It was a Bears game so it was a bit crowded but not enough for yet again terrible",1

"I have been to this location three times, and each time the service has been horrible.  The waitress actually flung our coasters at us the last time I was there.  The food is ok, but I cannot get passed the bad attitudes long enough to enjoy it.  The decor reeks of a chain restaurant trying to be unique.  Plus, if I wanted to spend $20 on a lunch, I would go somewhere that was worth it.  The prices are outrageous!",1

"On december 27, 2011 my family and my father that just came from Costa Rica went to your restaurant located in Jackson. Sorry to say but we had the worst meal ever and it was not about the food. It was due a little complain about the pizza we ordered. We order the veggie without broccoli and we get the pizza with the broccoli plus the 45 minutes to get the order completed. The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged. I talked to the manager and he said that he did not approved anything and he directly said that we ",1

ALL of my credit card information, name, address ect, were stolen to make a fraudulent XBOX live account, which charged 74.99 to my debit card.

"A friend and I decided to try this little eatery for a bite before our night class. We called ahead so that our pizza would be ready. We walk in to this dimly lit restaurant/pub (I now know why they have poor lighting, so you wont see all the food and residue on your glass). We sat down and got a big basket of fries, that was nice, but they weren't anything to jump up and down about. Our pizza came and it was awful. The cheese was super thick, the pepperoni was almost non-existent and the sauce...well, actually, what sauce? Overall, I'd avoid the place if you want a good deep dish pizza and a clean glass to drink from. Also, I ordered a diet coke, tasted like carbonated water with food coloring. I had to order Sprite instead.",1

I ate here with a business convention group of about 10 people. It was in the middle of the day at around 2pm and honestly, we could not get our waiters attention even if we searched and asked around. We had two extra guests come and they were waiting for 20 minutes for the waiter to notice and bring extra chairs and plates. The thing is, they were not even busy so it doesn't make sense why it took another 20 minutes for our water to come. Maybe this location is not good or just this waiter, but it was just unacceptable service. but don't get me wrong, the pizza is always amazing, this review is solely for the service.",1

Crust sucked, veggies were soggy and droopy...meat was nothing special.  The tastiest part of the meal was the marinara sauce I had to order to dip me pizza in because there was just no sauce.

If you don't want people ordering beer then don't put it on the menu. God forbid someone ordered a beer at Everest. I was wondering if they were going to put my picture up on the wall as the first person to ever be so uncouth as to order a beer. Then it took 20 minutes for him to bring it to my table.

The thin crust pizza that arrives is overcooked to the point of the pizza crust being brown (brown cheese really?) and no salt or flavor on anything. I call to complain and of course they tell me I need to wait another hour to get a replacement. Clearly my displeasure doesn't matter to them because they know people won't wait that long.

We were greeted by an overly energetic host who quickly took our names for a table. We were offered drinks to sip on while we wait. The actual wait wasn't that bad. So far so good. There's a sign on each table saying that they don't automatically bring you water because they're trying to be environmentally conscious and save Earth's natural resources. I thought that was unique. As one of my friends was trying to order a breakfast dish, she asked if she could substitute pancakes for toast. Now this is a simple request I believe.

Not to mention, the last time I went there with my boyfriend, they charged him $1.75 for what is equal to a cup of milk (if you're using a measuring cup) and the waitress told us refills aren't free. Are you kidding me with this? Not even a full glass of milk cost $1.75 and no refills.

This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous.

I ordered a bloody mary and they took that away before I finished the drink or even the olives!

"After enduring the first of three very sultry, very sweltering Lollapalooza days, my California cohorts and I were hungry to sink our teeth into some Chicago fare. As such, a few locals pointed us in the direction of Giordano's, which, according to these palate-challenged townies, is the holy grail of deep dish.   Now be advised, Chicagoans: Before you wrongly surmise that Californians have a penchant for all things bland, please take into account my former status as a Chicagoan. As a wee tike, the Dom enjoyed herself a good slice of pie of the deep dish persuasion from said eatery.

Bottles of wine all over the room and a neat open kitchen that makes you feel like part of the action but also makes sitting too close to the kitchen a little warmer than I find comfortable. Our server was fantastic - but I can't think of his name. He had some great input on our wine selection and his descriptions of the menu were very helpful.

So during my visit, my friends and I thought it would be a great idea to try Giordano's stuffed deep dish pizza to see what it was all about. $40 later, we had a large pizza that half went to waste in the trash can. We all had a slice and it was more than one can handle. The crust was thick, the sauce was lacking flavor, and the stuffed cheese overpowered the entire pizza. I couldn't taste the crust or toppings over the cheese. And we were all very unpleased. Let me not be so harsh by saying, that it's not that bad where some may not enjoy. But my preference, I just don't like the stuffing of the pizza at all. And the pizza is pretty hard to reheat leftovers so the rest of",2

Before this, we dined in and had one of the gourmet thin crust pizzas with a calimari/zucchini appetizer.  Service was okay, but once again, we did not find much value in what we ordered.  In fact, the bottom of the calimari/zucchini was stuffed with paper to make it look much more impressive than it really was.  Not cool.  Again, the pizza was good, but probably 25% overpriced.

If you live in Chicago I think you should definitely go there once or twice but there's much better deep dish pizza out there that is less bland.  If you really like deep dish check out Lou Malnati's -- their crust is amazing and their cheese & sauce is much better.",2

The next day I tried the Art of the Pizza and that's how I expected it to taste!! I would pass here and try somewhere else. But the service was friendly and prompt.",2
"This review is for the shake only.  I would like to come back sometime for a brunch/sammich. Found out about this place via a Gewgle'd milkshake article about where to bring the boys to the yard.  Eleven City popped up as #2 strawberry shake in Chicago, and it's located rather close to where this year's Shamrock Shuffle 8K finished.  So what better way to reward yourself after an 8K PR run than to slurp up a milkshake?  I know, right? I was feeling the vanilla on this day and was shocked that the shake was $7.  As the bf and I eagerly awaited the shakes, I was preparing myself for the best shake of my life... ... and that it was not.  In retrospect, that 'shake' was most likely a malt.  It had that whopper-like malt flavor, and it was way liquidy-er than I would have liked.   Service was a",1
"Nothing spectacular except they cut the ends of the hot dogs to look like flowers. Apart from the aesthetics, I can't say much. I ordered the Char Maxwell Street. While the poppy seed bun was soft, the hot dog wasn't as flavorful as much and I hoped. The topping were meh. The fries were a bit overly cooked. Such a shame because we sat across from a wall full of accolades and awards and press releases from their popular heyday.",2
"Parking was not a problem at this nook of a place. I came here with my family recently after an eventful morning and afternoon spent at an engagement party. We were all fairly hungry and my cousins decided if we were in Chicago, we HAD to have the stuffed pizza the city is famous for. Firstly, the service was terrible. We asked to be seated in a shaded area and all she could offer was the corner booth. We started closing the blinds ourselves and than the hostess finally started helping. This still did no justice as the blinds did not close tightly and there was painstaking sun hitting my eye. We asked again to be seated elsewhere, and since the other booths were too small, we opted to sit at one of the tables in the middle. Now you have to be really patient at this place. The waters came w",3

"Yet another Jerry Kleiner restaurant that fails to impress me; I find Gioco to be overpriced and the food simply average. There are no real standouts on the menu - you'll find the usual Italian offerings: carpaccio, calamari, pasta in a meat ragu sauce, and pizza. I did really like the ravioli di funghi, although Follia, which has since closed, made far better pasta (but suffered from a horrible location). I can actually deal with average Italian food, but what gets me about Gioco are the prices. Simply put, an $11 caprese salad better knock my socks off. We easily spent over $150 on dinner for two and it just wasn't worth it. The outside dining sounds nice, but it can actually pretty loud on Wabash, especially with the El thundering overhead.

"Cute place, but the pizza just wasn't good. When you order it, your waiter will tell you it takes a long time to make a pizza, and you say that's fine. For the next 45 min-hour, your hunger grows while thinking of the awesome pizza you're about to stuff your face with. When they bring it out to you, the place it on the special pizza stands that all of the tables have, and serve you your first slice. My friend and I got the stuffed crust pizza with sausage.. while the sausage was really flavorful and REAL, there was just wayyy too much cheese and not enough sauce. I mean really, there was barely any sauce. It was like.... some bread, layers upon layers of cheese, and a spoonful of sauce on each slice. If you go here, avoid the stuffed crust!",2
"College diner food in a Texas-sized hall with the tackiness and impersonality of Potbelly's... all at Manhattan prices. The menu clearly states a mission of being a casual, family neighborhood diner, 'what family dining rooms used to be.' It felt more like a parody of that. Nothing says 'cheapskates' like a $4.50 Schlitz. Except maybe $6.75 for Bell's Amber (really, you need that extra quarter for your laundry?), or apple pie a la mode for $7.15. Surprisingly unbohemian prices, considering it's next door to a Columbia College facility. To be fair, my food was fairly decent. Deli meats are roasted in house, and my turkey burger was freshly ground and served with not-too-greasy thick-cut fries.

The place was packed and came highly recommended, but I wasn't impressed.",2
"While I most certainly wasn't the bloke who was with Jelena Z that ill-fated day, I might as well have been because it was the same rationale that ended up landing me in the very same Elephant & Castle so many months later: hungry, not really sure where I was, in desperate need of wireless internet and a veggie burger. After finding a veggie burger on the menu and being assured there would be wireless, I nabbed a table with an outlet by myself and settled in to get some work. Now, here's where I made a rookie mistake: I ordered before confirming there was wireless. Because there definitely wasn't but at that point I had to stay or pay for a meal I didn't eat. Cue anger. Now it's a good thing the burger was actually pretty good, otherwise the whole thing would have just been a shitshow. But",2
"Oh the yuppie burger. 'OMG IT HAS NO HORMONES AND THAT IS SO GOOD FOR THE WORLD.' Epic Burger has obviously found it's niche -- most likely people in the loop who want to feel good about eating red meat and who probably shop at Whole Foods because Trader Joes isn't classy enough --  and I'm happy for them. When I got my burger and fries, they were cold. The cheese I had asked for on it wasn't on it and my shake was too thin.   I really wanted this place to be good, because at least once a month while working in the loop I really want some red meat and to be honest, the concept of this place DOES make me feel like it's ok to eat red meat once a month. I will leave the hormone free range blessed by jesus himself meat to everyone else and keep my meat consumption to a 2 hour wait at Kumas.",2
"A very average breakfast experience here. The breakfast menu is pretty limited and the entrees were nothing to rave about about. I had the two eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs had too much pepper on them. Wouldn't you let the customer handle if they want salt/pepper on their eggs? The hash browns were greasy. It took quite a long time for us to get our entrees although the place was not crowded. With Wildberry so close, I can't imagine coming back here anytime soon. I hope the lunch menu is better than their breakfast!",2
"Went to Gioco this past weekend with LK on our 'date night' before seeing the movie 'Date Night' and while we were not mistaken for another couple and subject to the capers that ensue in the movie we may have been better off skipping the night out and renting something on DVD. First off the place is pretty cool inside. Kind of a two tiered layout with a hip vintage feel to it. Bottles of wine all over the room and a neat open kitchen that makes you feel like part of the action but also makes sitting too close to the kitchen a little warmer than I find comfortable. Our server was fantastic - but I can't think of his name. He had some great input on our wine selection and his descriptions of the menu were very helpful. We started off with the mussels appetizer as per the recommendation of ma",2

Instead NFL network in July, Soccer, and espn news. Gotta be kidding me.. Strike 2 - I clearly ordered a 12 inch thin crust pizza but received and was charged for a large. Strike 3 - My drink sat empty at times... I was feeling under the weather that day so I didn't get to tap into their beer selection which looked pretty good. The pizza itself was pretty good. The price points are pretty high here. I think it will get a lot of tourist biz from the hotel across the street. Show owner comment »",2
"Very mediocre, overpriced experience. We shared one bottle of wine (40 bucks was on the very low end of the price spectrum), one appetizer, two pasta entrees and the bill was 100 bucks before tip. Really? Calamari fritti was pretty good for an appetizer.  I had wild mushroom ravioli for an entree.  I LOVE mushrooms and unfortunately, they did not use just the mushroom caps but also used the stems.  Wild mushroom stems are woody and not really good for eating.  So every few bites I'd get a hard, chewy piece and it really ruins the whole experience. My husband got the tagliatelle with boar (maybe it was ox? Menu had all weird meats). it tasted like beef stroganoff out of a box. As another reviewer said there are far too many wonderful italian restaurants in Chicago to bother to go to this pl",2
"In a word: disgusting This pizza COULD have been good, IF they cooked the effing dough.  Instead what I got was a pizza with a delightfully flaky outer edge, and a bottom that consisted of half cooked dough.  Nothing is as tasty as gooey dough, yum.  And it is 'stuffed' because they put another thin layer of dough over the top.  Then they put sauce on top of that.  So guess what other part of the crust is not cooked at all?  Bingo!  That top layer was so disgusting.  They at least put sauce on the pizza, unlike Lou Malnati's, but their sausage was not as good.  I did not like their chopped salad as much as the Malnati salad either. So Chicago, THIS is your idea of good pizza?  What a joke...",2

"I've been here quite a few times with people from work and it's always just ok.  I like how the deep dish pizza has a lot of cheese but it's not the best cheese, the sauce is pretty bland, and the crust isn't very good.  I've had the veggie deep dish twice and both times I really disliked it beause the veggies did not taste fresh at all.  The pepperoni deep dish is probably the best bet.  And the appetizers are pretty standard. If you live in Chicago I think you should definitely go there once or twice but there's much better deep dish pizza out there that is less bland.  If you really like deep dish check out Lou Malnati's -- their crust is amazing and their cheese & sauce is much better.",2

I went once with my boss, to give us the opportunity to sit down and talk through some work issues.  Because I knew I wasn't that into the pizza, I decided on the spaghetti, which was overcooked and mushy.  And on top of it?  That sauce.",2

Again, no complaints about the place itself, i just can't say i enjoyed the flagship product.",2

Once I ordered an omelet and when it arrived, it was sitting in a pool of butter. It was completely inedible because it was so saturated with butter. And don't get me wrong, I love me some butter. But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.'

So we heard this place was the best, and this one was literally across the street from our hotel! We ended up going twice! Once for pizza, and once to pick up dessert to go to eat in our hotel room! Their slices of cake are HUGE btw and if you actually think you will have room for dessert after you eat pizza here, then well....you must have really clogged arteries. Because their deep dish here is seriously deep dish. My brother who eats a ton had trouble eating two slices here, and I had to cut my second piece in half! We couldn't finish a small supreme deep dish to save our lives. So we brought it back to our room and ate it for breakfast t",3
"I've lost count of how many people recommended this place to us when we told them we were going to Chicago.. we didn't know how we felt about deep dish cheese stuffed pizza but knew we couldn't come to Chicago without giving the famous pizza a taste. They told us it'd be a 45 minute wait and that you could pre-order at the window since it'd take just as long to make the pizza. I definitely suggest pre-ordering while you wait. It was worth it as we were seated at least 15 minutes before we got our pizza. The small pepperoni stuffed pizza was more than enough for two people to share. My thoughts on the pizza itself - holy cheese. I expected a stuffed pizza but the amount of cheese used was overwhelming. I couldn't even cut through the bottom of the pizza with my knife (crust was way too hard",3

"We order from here from work and the food is okay.  I just went here this past Friday night for a rehearsal dinner.  While I wasn't in the wedding or even a member of the family, I could see the stress in the eyes of the bride and her family.  The bride had made a reservation for the back room months in advance.  Then the day before the event someone at Giordano's booked the same room for 3 bus loads of people.  Sure I understand you need to make money for your business, but you should always accommodate the guests that have booked well in advance and not have 50 people standing your lobby.   So once that was all settled and we were seated we were having issues getting everyone enough soda and water.  When the food came out, some of the pizzas were cooked and some where not.  Good think I ",3
"Sorry Chicagoans, I too was a bit disappointed by Giordano's.  Maybe my expectations were too high? It was definitely a really good pizza--don't get me wrong.  I like deep dish, stuffed, thin crust, brick-oven, you name it, so no, I'm not a pizza snob.  I guess I wanted to be blown away, and this just didn't do it. I got the 'Special' with green peppers, mushrooms and sausage.  The cheeze was amazing, the crust was clean but a little underflavored.  The sauce on top was not quite tomato-ey enough, but portions are bountiful.  I tried tackling a 10-incher by myself and was proud of myself for even getting to half of it.  (pizza-by-the-slice isn't an option during dinner hours). I'm definitely a fan of Zachary's Pizza in Oakland, CA.  Maybe I'll check out Lou Malnati's next time I'm back in ",2
"If you want to have Chicago's famous deep dish pizza - this is where to have it. I'm personally not much into pizza but this was not so bad. It's very filling - one slice will have you stuffed. The only thing though is I wish they had alfredo sause pizza instead of the usual tomatoe sauce. All in all, if you're a pizza fan, try it out.",3
"Okay, if I didn't love the Turkey burger here so much, I'd bail on this place. Level Up payment system down AGAIN, and the WiFi in here is never good. Cash only is a pain in the ass for someone who doesn't carry around a lot of cash. Also, it's sort of a crapshoot if your order is going to come back correctly. Went in here today, ordered my customary Turkey burger. Very simple. White bun, nothing but lettuce and pickle on it. What I got, was a Turkey burger with Pepper Jack cheese, and grilled onions . . . thankfully my lettuce and pickle was also on there. But, really. It even had my correct order on the receipt. So, I got bonus cheese, not really a BAD thing. But . . . everything else being equal, I'd like my burger the way I order it. Guys, seriously . . . pull it together. The place is",3
"I normally prefer thin crust pizzas, but visiting Chicago it way my duty to try the deep dish, twice. I love the crust here. Normally, all that cheese and bread bothers me, but this pizza is just delightful. And I love the sauce. Toppings almost don't even matter. I've had a hawaiian style and some sort of combo. Salads are also pretty good. The wait can be a little insane, even when you go during what I'd consider 'off' hours, like not lunch or dinner, but in between. This place is always packed.",3
"Pretty tasty popcorn, but they rip you off on the containers!! The lady didn't tell me that choosing a Chicago Cubs tin would cost almost $5 more than the traditional Garrett's tin. =( And the Cubs tin didn't even have a metal lid. It was a plastic one. Popcorn was good, but I think Dale and Thomas (?) is better.",3

"When I was planning my trip to Chicago, I had a friend recommend Giordano's to me, and after he sent me pictures of the thick slices of cheese and meat I knew I had to try it. 'Apparently they do national delivery!' I said. 'Yeah, but I'm not gonna pay $30 to have it delivered to me,' he replied. 'I love that you know exactly how much the delivery would cost.' Let me clarify that I wasn't disappointed by Giordano's pizza. There are other reviews that echo the bad service and I have to say that it's true. Firstly, it's extremely confusing that the official website lists this location under 130 E Randolph St but it's actually on 135 E Lake St. We placed a carry out order online for a sausage and mushroom pizza which went through fine, but when we went to the front desk (dine in) to ask for o",3
"I don't go out of my way to eat organically because I'm cheap, but I thought I'd give Epic Burger a try since I was in the area and was craving a burger.  I was right on it being expensive.  My organic burger + organic fried egg + organic fries + diet Pepsi (combo) totaled close to $11.  At least the organic Heinz ketchup was free. There's not much selection.  As far as burgers, you can either get the regular (comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, raw or grilled onions; fried egg, organic bacon, and choice of cheese are about $0.70 extra) or the BLT (which comes with the egg, bacon, and cheese already!) - both for $5.99.  They have 1 chicken sandwich option, 1 turkey burger option, and 1 portabello mushroom sandwich option.  That's about the entire menu.  They also offer combo meals (burg",3

The pizza was good, but the crust wasn't nearly as crispy as deep dish places in San Francisco (of all places) and the toppings seemed a bit soggy. I would certainly come back here but Chicago must have better...",3
"Deep-dish Pizza is what you get when you have Irish immigrants try their hands at making pizza.  It is the bastard child of a savory pie traditional of the Irish, British, and Scots with the flavor and ingredients of Italy. Deep-dish pizza flirts with its identity and pushes the definition of what is pizza to its absolute limits and is by far the most unique of all the styles of pizza one commonly finds. Even the crust is more like pie crust in texture and flavor then anything remotely like any other pizza you've had. It so happens that the crust is absolutely the best part of Giordano's pie. Sadly, the sauce is dense, sweet, and more reminiscent than I'd like to canned tomato paste. The cheese and toppings are fairly average. The whole experience is also pleasantly less greasy than one wo",3

"It's a pub with pub food, pub decor, and pub atmosphere. The menu has a few surprises but nothing ground-shaking. The service was fast, contrary to popular remarks. The food was ok.

Otherwise...average everything.",3

"Sign up for the Hop on Off Tour, and get a free sample coupon for here that will give you a sample big enough for a meal!! Their cheddar and caramel mixed bag is pretty tasty, but the caramel is definitely the winner in the battle of the bag. The cheddar is good, don't get me wrong, but it does turn your fingers kind of yellow and the taste of the cheddar just fills you up way faster than the caramel which is maybe a good thing so you don't over eat this stuff ha ha My brother and I couldn't finish our two samples without getting too full or done with the flavor, but it is no wonder this place is so famous in the theater district. The second this place opened that morning, there was already a line of people waiting to pick up bags of popcorn for their offices! And the bags you can buy here",3

"I feel kinda iffy about epic burger. On the one hand, I like that they had turkey burgers, whole wheat buns, etc. The fries were pretty good (didn't try the shakes - although someone else had and liked theirs.) That being said, I thought the turkey burger was kind of weird. It's very thin and the edges are really really thin. A bit hard to describe, but once you see it you'll know what I mean. I found it to be odd and not terribly enjoyable because of that. Overall, not my favorite place.",3
"I finally returned to Eleven City.  We waited for over twenty minutes for brunch, and after realizing that it would probably be another twenty minutes or more, we left.  While I waited, I perused the menu and just got irritated.  The breakfast menu was just so overpriced and it seemed like they would nickel-and-dime you for everything.  $12 for french toast?? Really??  I'll probably still go back for some lunch though.... Over to my trusty Yolk we went for a fabulous breakfast at half the price!",3

Both times I ordered a dirty martini and both times I was not that impressed with the overall taste, plus the bartender reached into the olive dish with his bare hands (toothpick, please) to get the olives for my drink...where have his hands been?  Ew.  So I stuck to vodka/tonics after that, and they were good. A good spot if you are in the loop.  Laid back, good crowd, strong drinks.",3

"Holy moley! I've had deep dish before, but never in Chicago and not quite like this. I'm just gonna put out there before I review that I prefer thin crust NY style pizza when I have a choice of pies and I am also lactose intolerant. There was a little bit of a wait, about 20 minutes or so, but I was ok with that. We were able to put in our pizza order before we got a table which was good. Now for the pie, it was truly a pie. The crust was thick and firm, the sauce was on top and the cheese was sandwiched in the middle. It was gooey and a bit too cheesy and salty for my taste, but my hubby loved it. He made me go there two nights in a row. When in Chicago, I guess. The salad I got, a Caesar, was just ok. Go for the experience.",3

"We had a deep dish pizza with half supreme (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions) and the other half with our own mix (sausage and pepperoni). This was very cheesy. I mean the second you cut it cheese slides all over the place. I think a slice of pizza is about 60% cheese on slice that's 2 inches thick. The crust was not corn meal but more buttery, think a buttery pillsbury croissant in the twist can. We also ordered calamari which was good. It was crispy on the outside and just  melts in your mouth. There was about 1-2 pieces that were a bit rubbery out of the whole plate. I think I expected more from the pizza. But I guess I have to preface this by saying I'm not a huge fan of cheese. For those from the bay area in California I think windy city in San Mateo is more flavorful tha",2

I don't like waiting ONE AND A HALF hours to be served an OK pizza. NO.",3
"Having tried Gino's East, Giordano's, and Zachary's, Little Star, and Patxi's (in the SF Bay Area), I can't say Giordano's is the best. Sure, it was good, but for me, a bit too much cheese. I like the stuffing and each bite was full of sausage, onions, and green peppers. As with any deep dish, it's hard to eat more than two slices. A small size could potentially feed 3 people here. A good pizza, but good to know that my Bay Area choices can satisfy my cravings for deep dish.",3
"Walking into ECD is like walking into a more upscale Fat Moe's in the movie 'Once Upon a Time in America.'  The interior is very well done if only a tad over the top with the Hebrew motif.  It's a loft space with high ceilings, great concrete pillars, huge angled mirrors rising up above the bar and all kinds of kitsch from framed paintings of rabbis, menorahs and old framed up LP covers.   The soundtrack here consists of jazz such as Billie Holiday, Louie Armstrong and tunes like 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes' -  stuff you might have heard in Fat Moe's in the movie if not for the Morricone soundtrack. Before we walked in I figured we'd run into a bunch of college kids hanging around studying given the area.  That wasn't the case.  And I found out why when I opened up the menu.   Nine bucks for ",3

I'm going to try it again, hopefully I'll change my thoughts.",3

The dip was good, though I'm not sure it was stellar - although I was hungry so it was fantastic! Hmm, the pizza. We ordered the stuffed pizza with fresh tomatoes and pepperoni, but really they sell a cheesy-stuffed cheese pizza - there were about 4 slices of tomato on top of the pizza and I found 2 pieces of pepperoni in my slice, so you might as well just order the cheese pizza.

Service was 2 stars, at best.  My date and I met midday on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty, but they refused to seat my boyfriend before I got there.  Then when I did get there, I had a big suitcase because I was coming direct from Midway and when I used the side door instead of the revolving door, I got scolded by a hostess.  The candy counter guy was kind enough to stow my suitcase while we ate, but when I went to retrieve it, no one was there and it was ju",3

And as some other reviewers have mentioned, where's the sauce? if the the whole purpose of the deep dish pizza is for one to stuff as much ingredients in there as possible, then i'd like to see the sauce portion to be at least half as proportionate as the cheese.  Anyhow, i don't think I'd miss the pizza here.",3

"I would like to give Elephant and Castle 2.5 stars....but I'll go with three.  The food is decent...not outstanding, but decent.  I especially enjoy the shepherd's pie, when I am craving comfort food.  Service is uneven:  I've had some great servers, and other times the service is just adequate.  I work nearby, so have been there mostly for lunch.  It's usually packed at lunch, so consider going a little early or a little late if you don't want to wait.",3
"Ep ic - adjective: heroic; majestic; impressively great. I am going to call this a bit of stretch of the truth.  Don't get me wrong, 'Epic' has solid burgers, but heroic? NOT. Majestic? HARDLY. Impressively great? NOPE. Kind of a greasy, cheese dripping experience.  I added a fried egg because I felt the need to add cholesterol to my system.  Fries were good and I think this place is a pretty decent value. Bottom line?  I would not make a special trip to come here, but if you happen to be in the area and need to grab a quick bite? Worth it.",2
"I debated with myself over giving Epic 3 or 4 stars. In the end, I won the debate (I know, I'm as surprised as you are) and went with 3. Getting the trivialities out of the way first: The space is pretty nice. Clean, modern, warm. Like an upscale fast food place. Which is what Epic Burger is. They built the place expecting long lines. You can basically have a line from the front door to the counter (way in back, and it's a deep space) without interfering with anything or annoying the patrons dining in the restaurant. Unfortunately you can't see the menu until you get up near the counter, so you can't use your time waiting in line (I went in a bit early and didn't have to wait) to study the menu and decide what you want. Fortunately, the menu is small and doesn't take long to study when you",3
"very much a touristy deep-dish sensation. although it is good they have certainly become a franchise and have gone off what made them so great. however, I still enjoy a deep dish Giordano's pizza for old times sake. usually with the family because they find it acceptable to wait such a long time to be seated. I usually bypass this and get a better pizza. But i am a good grandpa.",3
"Grace's must be surviving by the Grace of God alone because on my four or five visits over several years I've not seen much in the way of patrons there.  I've been to Grace's on the weekend and during the week, and there is always plenty of space available.  I can only assume they pack them in on Bears' game day. Fare wise, I have only had their sliders, which are okay.  They seem to have a tinge of sweetness that may be from the bun which is a bit interesting.  The thin cut fries we got at the latest visit were like those shoestring potatoes you get in the tin at the store - dry and crunchy.  No, tanks for nuh-tin.   I have to give Grace's kudos for having Two Brothers Domaine Dupage on tap.  I highly recommend you try a pint of this brew.  You'll be buying six packs of it at the store af",3
"There is nothing wrong with this particular Jimmy Johns. I just am not a fan of Jimmy Johns in general. The only thing that Jimmy Johns has going for it is the speed with which they make the sandwiches. They slop that meat and bread together in seconds. Amazing. Then you bite into the sandwich and it is far from amazing. If I want a cold sandwich, I'll go to Subway. At subway I get to choose from tons of toppings (olives, peppers, cucumbers...yum) and I get oil and vinegar as well. If I want a really good sandwich, I'll go to Pastoral or Goodwin's. There's just nothing special about Jimmy Johns. Potbelly's is superior to Jimmy Johns. At Potbelly's I can get delicious shakes and my beloved oatmeal cookies. To each his own. Jimmy Johns just isn't for me.",2
"The pizza was OK. We went to Ginos East and tasted what Chicago, deep-dish pizza was supposed to be. Had we not gone to Gino's, Giordano's would probably be a 3 1/2 stars, but now I realize how badly they miss the grade.",3
"I went here for some drinks on a Wednesday night and the atmosphere was great. This is great place to hang out and drink on a weekday. As for dinner, not so sure, we ordered nachos which came out burnt. Otherwise its a great place to hang out with a group a friends.",3
"I love the old-style deli feel of Eleven City Diner, but the food prices are another story. While the portion sizes are somewhat large, the food doesn't feel worth the $30 two people might drop there. The tuna melt I ordered was drenched in cheddar cheese, but otherwise not too terrible. I enjoyed my everything bagel I opted for upon my second visit. The food here is just OK, nothing more, nothing less.",3
"I've been to the Emerald Loop twice now.  I did not eat either time, however.  But, the drinks are strong and that gets them an A-OK. Each time I went it was later in the evening.  Both times there was a big crowd and the atmosphere was fun.  The servers are attentive, the bartenders are fast, and the seating is plentiful. Both times I ordered a dirty martini and both times I was not that impressed with the overall taste, plus the bartender reached into the olive dish with his bare hands (toothpick, please) to get the olives for my drink...where have his hands been?  Ew.  So I stuck to vodka/tonics after that, and they were good. A good spot if you are in the loop.  Laid back, good crowd, strong drinks.",3
"Being a salaryman near the station, I often find myself wandering the food courts looking for a delicious lunch to eat. When I see this place, I think of chicken wings, however they dont serve them at this branch... so sad. Food is oily and good. Prices arent bad either..",4
"This is *the* place to go for deep dish Chicago pizza.  Forget Uno (they're overpriced and overcrowded).  Giordano's is where it's at.  The sauce is fantastic, the crust is perfect and the fillings are generous.  It tastes better fresh than cold leftovers in the fridge, but either way, it's still better than what we can get out here in California...",4
"Good spot for cheap, fresh brunch.   Definitely get the scones, which change every visit.  Each serving comes with two scones -- perfect for sharing!",4
"This place is great late. This is a good place to have a pastrami sandwich.",4
"Oh, yeah! Stack that meat up!  Yeah!  Stack it up! I could see the size of my 'New Yorker' sandwich--half pastrami, half corned beef on rye with swiss--from across the dining room as our server approached our table. For a brief, fleeting moment, I was afraid that my sandwich may eat *me*!  It was an enormous stack of tasty, fresh-sliced meat. More flavorful than Manny's (Go ahead, old timer, smack my face for saying it!). There's an impressive salad bar, which I have yet to sample. And drinks are self-serve and re-fillable. All that for about $10.  Niiiiice!",5
"It looks like this place gets really mixed reviews, but I thought it was delicious. This was only my second trip to Chicago, and I didn't have any Chicago-style pizza last time. Getting a thick slice this time was a must on my to-do list. The 40+ minute wait was worth it in my opinion. The service was brisk, lacking and borderline rude, but the deep dish pizza was good enough that I brushed it off. You definitely only need one piece if you typically eat two pieces. I think everyone knows by now that Chicago-style is at least one inch thick and filled with 'toppings'. The crust was golden, thick and crunchy. I could actually go for some right now...I can compare Uno's pizza to Giordano's since I work right by one here in Columbus.   Did anyone else get a 40 second window from the first time",4
"I have to say I'm surprised by all the bad reviews for Edwardo's.  I'm usually more critical than most yelpers. I went to Edwardo's after being robbed.  I withdrew some money from my checking account, cancelled all my cards, filed a police report, called my mom and cried, and decided to get some comfort pizza from Edwardo's, since it was nearby.  It was effective. At first I thought 'healthy pizza?  If I wanted something healthy, why would I get pizza?'  Not that I have a problem with healthy food - I like food that's naturally healthy, but food that's normally fattening and has been altered to be healthy makes me suspicious. If I were in the mood for healthy food I'd get japanese or korean or a salad.   But I looked in the window, and to tell the truth, none of the customers ar Edwardo's ",5
"First time in Chicago. Casual spot near our hotel. Good pizza, very filling, great service. We called in our order for a large group (30+), upon arrival the pizzas were ready, service was prompt and well-synchronized. Enjoyable experience. What I ate: sausage & cheese deep dish.",5
"I've had the veal (good), parpadelle w/boar (better), pizza and beef carpaccio (betterer), and the pork tenderloin (best).  Been here with 2 people, 4 people and 20 people.  Service has always been good, food has always been great, and ambiance has always been warm and cozy. I like Gioco and in terms of Italian restaurants (because I HATE to pay for pasta) this one is worth my hard earned money.",4
"Pretty cool place for an after work dinner and beers. I stopped in here yesterday with a colleague after first heading to Berghoff and finding it totally jammed. I thought the service was perfectly fine, not awesome but not unfriendly or slow. I had bangers and mash, pretty much my standard British pub meal and was not disappointed. The bangers were authentic and yummy, mash and beans were as expected. My London Porters Jack & Cokes were fine too, although my last Jack & Coke was kind of a stingy pour. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to stop by here but if you're in the Loop and want a solid, affordable meal and a couple of pints, E&C is worth a try.",4
"Our service was prompt, our waitress was nice, and the food (I had pancakes with fresh berries and whipped cream, with a side of potatoes) was yummy and filling. And yet, that has absolutely NOTHING to do with my rating. They have Vernors. *turns away to discreetly wipe a tear* Vernors! You have to understand that I am from Michigan and Vernors was the only ginger ale we ever bought and the best cure for whenever I felt a little sick to the tummy. But getting Vernors in Chicago is no easy feat. And that damn Canada Dry stuff doesn't make me smile like my home state staple. So yes, my entire rating is based off the availability of one of my favorite beverages. And none of you will judge me for it!",5
"Another fine food establishment for the South Loop!!!",4
"Another one of my favorite summer spots!  I've also found a whole new love for Jamba Juice ever since they introduced their low(er) calorie smoothies- just as good and half as many calories!  The strawberry nirvana is my favorite and I always get an immunity vitamin in it to keep the germs away!",4
"I'm not over it....been back 5 times and keep 'refining' the order...Here's what I have so far.  Single epic on toasted egg roll, raw onion, let, tom, ket, must, no special sauce.  With all the choices they offer, I find the simple burger is the way to go!  I saw some dude get an egg on top of his double...nicely played my man!",4

"Was in town and my cousin insisted we go to Giordanos if we wanted real Chicago pizza. I'm so glad we went. We were starving when we got there after walking several country miles around town. We ordered the combination appetizer - mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini sticks and fried mushrooms - you can see the theme here breaded and deep-fried, all good, served with marinara sauce and ranch. Mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were my favorite the zucchini was a bit mushy, but still ok. We decided to 'the special' deep-dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onion and green pepper. We added spinach on one half and pepperoni on the other half. With a pizza this thick it took 40 minutes to bake but the results are divine and our waitress warned us ahead of time. The cheese is ooey-gooey, stringy delic",4
"Jamba Juice is the perfect thing when you want something filling and don't feel like your usual morning coffee.  I love their smoothies and I have trouble deciding which one to get every single time!  They have a ton of locations around the city but this is the one I usually go to and the people are so nice and they have low calorie smoothies which are really good!",5
"It's Chicago deep-dish pizza, so how can it be any better!?  Giordano's is, all in all, pretty good.  It's somewhat similar to Edwardo's in Hyde Park, which is fine with me because I'm a big fan of Edwardo's.    This place has lunch specials that consist of individual-size deep dish pizzas that come out of the oven pretty quickly, so if you don't want to wait an hour for pizza then you can eat quickly.  The service here is pretty good and pretty consistent, but it can get very, very busy.  All in all, this is a pretty good pizza place!",4
"Good loop bars open on the weekends are hard to find - Emerald Loop is one of them.  I went on a Saturday night, and was really surprised the place wasn't packed because it's a quality restaurant/bar! I was craving wings, and got plump, golden Teriyaki wings for $10, along with a Sierra Nevada (they have a beer special every month) for $4.  My bf got the chicken marsala for $13, piled high with chicken, carmelized onions, and fried gnocci with savory sauce.   The good service, and college football playing on 5 screens were an added bonus.  It might become a weekend favorite - I need to check out their hot and curry wings first.",4
"WOW! Best pizza I have ever had in my life! We were told that we could pre-order our pizza while we waited in line but since we were not in a hurry we decided not to. 35 minutes from order to serve - well worth the wait. Small 10' is plenty for 4 regular eaters. Delicious tall, crispy biscuit crust and very very cheesy. Beer was cheap enough but I really wish they served Guinness. The waitstaff was fast and friendly. This place is super clean- not a speck of ick. I held back one star because the womens bathroom was clean. But it is very tiny, falling apart and impossible for a wheelchair. They certainly seemed to get enough traffic $ to fix that problem.",4
"My boyfriend and I went here for the UFC fight the other night.  First time there even though we both live nearby.  We got there early enough and were bale to snag a table with ample views to multiple tv's.  Started off with some beer.  Nice selection, I've seen better, but it was pretty good.  He had the South Loop lager and liked it, but it was a bit too hoppy for me.  We split an app of loaded tater tots.  They were fine, but nothing special.  However, it was a good place to watch the fight; not too crowded or loud.  We will probably be back for the next one!",4
"Thank god there is a huge line keeping me from going here all the time because I really do love this popcorn. Cheese and caramel together- wow! I order their tins of popcorn online as gifts for people all the time- everyone loves it!",4
"Goodwins is a great place to go for lunch in the loop. There are so many good options and all their wraps and sandwiches use Boars Head meats. I would suggest going with a wrap because they include chips with salsa and guac for free! My favorite wrap is the Flagstaff (Chicken breast, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, leaf lettuce and Monterey Jack cheese.)",4
"Great place for pizza. And a pretty good location, too. Be careful not to order too much. A couple slices are almost too much. The service at this location seems to be very odd. The first time we went, we waited for 40 minutes just to get drinks. And then another 40 for the pizza (and I know it takes a long time to cook). Another time, one of the waiters (not ours) kept staring at us and I'm still not sure why. It doesn't matter though. Its great pizza. (Just order the deep dish cheese and you'll be happy)",4
"Wow, you Chicagoans don't play around when it comes to making uber-thick pizza!  Six of us newbies showed up at Giordano's and ordered three medium deep-dishes and appetizers.  We were famished so we figured half a pizza each... Oy, the menu wasn't kidding when it said each pizza serves 3-4 people!  By the time we were done, we'd only finished half of what was on the table and our eyes were rolling into the backs of our heads.  I lost my deep-dish cherry to the spinach and special, and I'm still having foodgasms thinking about it.",4

"Not even a whole block away from the job so it should be a no-brainer that this be my go to spot for afterwork drinks. Actually I have been here only 3 times in the 3.5 years I have worked so close to it. Usually a suit & tie crowd or at least slacks and shirts. Drinks can be a little expensive here so maybe thats the reason I don't frequent. All 3 times I have been I have stumbled out in a drunken state, so I definitely recommend this joint if you work nearby. By the way, this place is connected to the Allegro Hotel",4

"Yes, hole-in-the-wall diners are romantic in that they remind you of the good ol' days and David Lynch and small town America, blah, blah, blah.  Let's face it though, every greasy spoon diner in Chicago is more or less the same - not tasty and not particularly clean.  Eleven City is not an authentic diner but it has AMAZING decor.  Eleven City diner is slightly pricey compared with it's competitors but it has AMAZING food.  Eleven City diner has awful customer service but AMAZING pie.  I always leave there feeling the meal was worth paying a few extra bucks for and I might even add it to my fictional Chicago must-see list.",4
"Eventually the Eleven City Diner won me over.  The owner is nuts.  Service is mixed.  But the food is great and the portions are over the top.  And don't miss the turkey burger - they try to sell you on it for good reason.  That thing is great.  Beer is a plus.",5
"Visited Chicago for Independence Day weekend. Wanted to try Chicago style pizza. I tried Giordano's since it was very close to my hotel (Hyatt). The wait was.... LONG! 30 min wait to be seated. Once we were seated, the waiter asked if we had 'Pre-ordered', I wasn't aware that this was an option... I asked the hostess 3 times how much longer to be seated and she never mentioned anything about Pre-ordering... I now know better.. After we placed our order it was another 50 mins before the pizza made it to the table... Im deducting a star for the incredibly long wait. Now for the good, the pizza was AWESOME, FABULOUS, DELISH!! We all LOVED it!! We ordered Sausage,pepperoni,mushroom pizza. As this was our first Chicago style pizza we had no idea what size to get... we went w/ a large for 3 peop",4

Item: my dining companion and I accumulated nine plates by the end of our meal, as the waiter inexplicably brought four dinner-sized plates upon which to eat the appetizers. Item: we spent 1.5 hours in the restaurant *after sitting down*.

"I always order Giordano's pizza.One of the best deep dish pizzas here in Chicago. The sauce is amazing with all the different spices. I always order stuffed spinach and it is amazing. They always deliver on time. They have a great dinning area. They can make pretty much any toppings for your pizza. The crust of the pizza is strong it does not fall apart when you pick it up. There are many locations all around the Chicago area.",4
"'Epic' has a special meaning in the soundtrack of my life. Rather than the dictionary meaning, I can still see the vinyl spinning round in those bluish-purple colors on the living room stereo beneath the 70's hanging globed light. As a kid, it was a close as I could get to a mirrored disco-ball. Epic, of course, meant 'Epic Records' home of the former Jackson 5 singer whose name I shared. Dancing at home on Friday nights, I pretended to be living 'Off the Wall' & wondered what it would feel like 'Working Day and Night'...ooh Lawd. That kind of work could only be rewarded with an 'Epic' meal. I found it in this modern-looking burger joint in the near South Loop after a long day's work. After climbing past the tragically hip chain smoking college students who loitered outside the door like l",4
"Whenever I get a burger craving, I like to hop on the red line to Epic Burger because the burgers are consistently yummy.  The patties have crisped edges, and they also toast the buns.  Toppings are pretty simple: lettuce, tomato, onions (grilled or raw), pickles, and special sauce.  Just a great tasting no-fuss burger with the right amount of toppings that don't overwhelm the meaty taste.  Extra add-ons are bacon, fried egg, and cheese (havarti, cheddar, blue).   Also, they use biodegradable cups and utensils!",4
"Elephant and Castle is seriously under-appreciated in my book.  Having their corporate offices in Boston, and my natural love for Boston makes me an automatic fan, but they back it up with quality food and service.  I like that they have cider both on tap and in bottles and the food is really fresh.  I will often get the lamb curry or the bacon barbeque burger and soup (yummy tomato basil on Tuesday) or splurge (calorie-wise) on fish and chips or sheperd's pie.  All are tasty and huge portions. I think I like this location more than the one on Adams - seems less cramped and less dark.",4
"Wow. That is all I can say. My friends from out-of-town and I spent an evening dining at Gioco and we were all blown away. We started out with fried calamari and prosciutto appetizers and they were amazing. The sauces with the fried calamari were sensational. Around the horn, my date had pasta (I don't recall which one, but I know it was the one that was made with speck) and it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I had the pork tenderloin scallopini and it was also great-- fantastic potato salad-esque side dish. The dish of the night was ordered by my friend's fiancee-- she had the veal entree and after trying one bite I was kicking myself for not ordering that as well. Damn it. Finally, my friend had the dual beef filets, which were also delicious, though he was not as big a",4
"There are two parts to Epic Burger. 1. The amazingly delicious Burger.  It was really one of the best I've had in a long time.  It was fresh, it was juicy, and it was quick.  I got the burger with an egg on it, and that was a very good choice.  The special sauce was also good, and the bun topped off the deliciousness. 2. The kind of really disappointing fries. They were really hot when we got them, and then they quickly cooled off into a soggy mess.  The taste was something to be desired as well.  We got two orders, but when the fries arrived, we could have easily shared one order. It was really cool to have cups that were biodegradable, and the staff was nice, even though I had no idea what to order for the first 5 minutes.   The Staff and the burger outweigh the fries.   Probably will go",4
"Grillers is cash only so my trip today was a treat considering I'm usually only a plastic purchaser. I had the veggie burger and onion rings. The onion rings are pretty standard, and certainly would have been better with tempura batter, but the veggie burger was very, very tasty. I got it with everything on it, mayo, onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and ketchup, it was pretty perfect. The bun is large, making it look like this is the biggest burger you've ever had, and is fluffy, covered in ground sesame. Overall, this place seems great for its location. The only competition it faces right now is Subway, which gets old very fast. Grillers has a LARGE variety of choices so if they got a credit card machine, they'd really be bumpin.",4
"Yes, i am rating this in the company of all my great experiences.  4 stars for old school, old fashioned mid west awesome-ness.  Thanks yelpers for letting this West Coast girl know where to go on her first night in town.   After a fairly long day, this was exactly what the doc ordered.  Braving the cold, we ducked into this joint and were a little weary of the indoor smoking (or at least smoke smell), but were starving, so all issues were now out the window.   We were in the Midwest, time to bundle up, shut up, and eat.  What could be better than an onion ring tower and a Boddington's to hold over the appetite?  Nada.  The onion rings were perfect, complete with ranch and ketchup dipping sauces.   Next, deep dish pizza brought out on a rolling cart.  I have to say, there is nothing like a",4

"Yum! Such a mouthful of deep dish pizza can only spell out one thing in the end: F-O-O-D C-O-M-A. Literally, I think I napped after just one slice of these bad boys. Who cares if you don't finish the whole thing? It's still amazing after a day in the fridge, and Giordano's for leftovers is surely better than what I can make for lunch.",4
"My office orders from Goodwin's a lot for meetings, or just for lunch.  And so far, I've really enjoyed their food!  I usually order he Santa Rosa Tortilla Wrap which comes with black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and provolone cheese that comes with a side of tortilla chips and salsa.  It's one of the best wraps I've ever had, and I'm not a wrap person!  Taste is great as it has a spicy kick to it with the pico de gallo.  I've also tried their various soups of the day and have not been let down so far! Overall, good food, okay service (only ordered for delivery), and okay prices.",4
"A block from home I found this place.  We ordered an app and a pie.  The wings and onion rings were really good.  The pizza was super cheesy and excellent fuel to help me take a nap.  The waitstaff was awesome.  I appreciate that Roger Ebert gave this place 4 stars and not 2 thumbs up since I'm unfamiliar with him reviewing things in this manner it was difficult to compare the pizza at this restaurant to his review of Titanic.",4

I have had the fish and chips as well as the Shepherd's Pie (which, if you ask a Brit or so I've heard, is actually 'Cottage Pie') and both have been good and reasonably priced. Last night we went with friends at 9pm on a Thursday (wanting a relatively inexpensive place) and E&C was packed and albeit a bit loud with some overserved yuppies, but we were seated immediately.

But, it is completely good and a must try. Keep in mind though, that you have to wait 45 minutes for the pie to cook, so I suggest ordering a few apps to go with it. Since the pizza is so heavy, we had the Greek Salad which was an enormous plate and enough to feed the 2 of us. Our service at this particular location was okay, nothing to really review about. We came in late, around 10pm so that could have had something to do with it. I'll have to try the thin crust next time I'm in the great city of Chicago.",4
"It's just way to tempting to have this place at the corner where dozens of buses and trains go breezing by every day.  You will see many happy commuters munching away on their tasty, fresh popped corn.  You have to get the combo bag - butter, carmel and cheese all rolled into one.  How cool is that?!",4
"I just had my first meal here.  In recent years I've dramatically cut my burger consumption for health reasons and lost my taste for most french fries, so this had to excel to impress me. There are enough reviews so I'll stick to why the food will bring me back.  The burger was so juicy it dripped a bit as I ate it.  Just a bit crisp on the outside, thoroughly cooked inside and very substantial without being excessive.  It was juicy but not greasy.  Still, I can't imagine ordering a double.  The trimmings are what you'd expect.  I got a fried egg on mine which was perfectly cooked and gave a nice added flavor and texture, especially with the yolk just runny enough to enjoy but not enough to drip out.  A large toothpick was also a nice touch to keep the insides from sliding out the back as ",4
"Y'know, my recent review of Wiener World in Pittsburgh http://www.yelp.com/biz/ reminds me of the time I learned to NEVER order ketchup on a hotdog.  I know it was Gold Coast Dogs and I'm pretty sure it was this one.  I was visiting my Chicago friend Catherine a few years ago and because she knows I love hotdogs, she suggested this place. Well I ordered a charbroiled dog with the dreaded tomato concoction on it.  Trays dropped!  Gasps of horror were emitted from all the connoisseurs dining on fine encased meats!  Buzzes and hushed tones of 'She ordered WHAT on her hotdog?'.  A silence fell on the establishment.  The manager came out from behind the counter and without a word pointed towards the exit.  I made my egress, head hung low, doing a walk of shame as if expelled from a military ac",4
"I hate you Giordano's. As I'm sitting here two time zones west of you, all I can do is dream about having another meal at your place. **Raises fist in the air** We originally were planning to grab take out since you need about 30 minutes of wait time when you order a stuff crust pizza. The weather was nice, so maybe some pizza in Millennium Park was the idea. We phoned it in and took our time walking over. However, when we walked into the place and saw that it wasn't over flowing with people, we quickly asked if it would be okay we dined in instead. Simple décor, what a pizzeria should look like: checkered table cloths, long dining rooms, a full bar in the corner. All it was missing was an mini arcade for the kids! Dining in was actually their benefit because we ended ordering the chicken ",4
"Was in town and my cousin insisted we go to Giordanos if we wanted real Chicago pizza. I'm so glad we went. We were starving when we got there after walking several country miles around town. We ordered the combination appetizer - mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini sticks and fried mushrooms - you can see the theme here breaded and deep-fried, all good, served with marinara sauce and ranch. Mushrooms and mozzarella sticks were my favorite the zucchini was a bit mushy, but still ok. We decided to 'the special' deep-dish pizza with sausage, mushrooms, onion and green pepper. We added spinach on one half and pepperoni on the other half. With a pizza this thick it took 40 minutes to bake but the results are divine and our waitress warned us ahead of time. The cheese is ooey-gooey, stringy delic",4
"What can I say, I have been asking for a more lively sports bar in the area and here it is! Modern, great food, hdtv's, music, good staff. Comparing this to the other sports bar's in the South Loop: Wabash Tap (as classy as a dive bar can get, I would be here if I were attending one of the colleges), Weathermark (good bar, but needs more TV's if billed a sports bar), Krolls (family oriented, comfortable). Opera is now becoming a sports bar, so we will see how that is, but Jimmy Green's is the place if you are looking to stand or sit watching a game.",4
"Just wanted to update and say that they no longer offer the porterhouse. Came here the other night and as always, service was impeccable and we got a lot of personal attention: water glasses always filled, plates taken away, bread refilled, etc. Food was delicious. I had the linguine with white clam sauce. The clams were fresh and sweet and the pasta was al dente. Perfect. The dish came wrapped in paper and foil, which was different and I'm thinking the clams were steamed in this package right before arriving to the table. However it was kinda weird eating out of the foil and paper. Did our server forget to remove it for me? Was I supposed to pour the contents onto my plate myself? *shrugs* Still very tasty and I think this will be my regular dish here. And the rapini was still as good as ",4
"One of the downtown outposts of a Chicago institution!  They'll give you samples if you ask... and it's all good! The ones with nuts are sweet and decadent (and they come in nicer bags), and the Chicago mix is unbeatable (and makes a great gift for someone picking you up from the airport!) The fact that the sports tins are $3 more is pretty ridiculous.  Otherwise, it would be 5 stars easy!",4
"I  thought I would give Epic a try, I work just down the block.  A bunch of my co-workers and I checked it out.  I ordered a Portebello burger for $5.99.  Huge mushroom on a Delicious whole wheat bun, good Epic special sauce, normal burger fix ins and add Wisconsin cheddar for .89.  a bag of hand cut fries is $2 but is huge and can easily be shared.   I loved my burger, very tasty.  Fries were good too. All meats are naturally raised and they seemed to care about the environment (disposable silverware that was corn based and bio degradable ) but the recycling can was no where to be found..hmmm Over all my co-workers and I enjoyed our burgers and they were Epic in proportion.  I will go back and split a burger and fries!",4
"My favorite burger in chicago....  fresh ingredients = fresh taste plain and simple.  The sauce is good!  The fries are pretty good too.  They use horizon milk for their milk shakes which is probably another reason why this place is so good.  Hands down way better burger than that over-rated kumas corner burger.  The only drawback is lack of close parking.",4
"Came here for the first time for lunch today.  Its nothing mind blowing, but they executed their business right.  The workers were friendly, the place was clean, and their service was good. I had the salad bar and for $7.50 all you can eat, you can't go wrong. They even have sides and pudding/mousse for dessert.  While I can't vouch for their sandwich/soup selection, I'm def going to add it to my downtown lunch rotation.",4
"Burgers are as controversial as politics. Some like them big, thick, and rare, some like them embellished with anything short of a salad, and some like them plain, thin and dripping with grease. I thought Epic Burger was a good compromise between my desire for healthy (ie not industrialized) meat with toppings and my husband's desire for greasy, meaty burger. It wasn't as meaty as he had hoped, but it pretty much fit the bill for the rest of the requirements. I don't think it's better or worse than any other of the good burger joints I've been to in the city - it's just different! We stopped in after an afternoon at the museum and a walk through the park. We both got burgers and fries. I didn't think $20 was too much to drop on the meal - there was a little bit of service involved (they br",4
"Went here last week for a party. They did a really nice job, I know they have a few bars so they know what they are doing. Its a big open space which is decorated very tastefully although I prefer a cozier bar. I have to admit I know 2 staff members,not that we hang out but we used to work together,so I am not going to comment on service!",4
"Chicago Pizza is completely different from New York pizza.  Giordano's is not a place for foodies, but does qualify for All-Madden status.  It's the kind of place you go to when you have a healthy appetite.  The stuffed deep dish pizza is truly wonderful, but you need a large party of people to handle the quantity.  Surprisingly the spaghetti and lasagna are also wonderful due to their simple but special marinara sauce.  It is amazing how many restaurants do not know how to make marinara sauce!  I wish this place had a Times Square branch!  Anyway, I have spent many a meal at Giordano's and have never been disappointed!  Now there is a statement I do not make often.",5
"A must try place while you are in shy town. Where else can you get a 10 lb pizza? Still prefer thin crust though",4
"Where else you gonna go in the south loop? South Loop Club? I hope not!!! This place is way better with solid food, decent drink prices, and great weekday lunch specials! The decor is very cool. The place was done right. Went here on game day for a bears game and had a great time. They've got free wifi so you can keep up with your fantasy league without totally killing your iPhone battery. In the summer they open up their windows. If you need to mix things up from kaseys, bar Louie, blackies, or the hack... This is your spot! Oh yea.. Waffle fries...",4
"Gioco is a nice Italian spot - with modern decor and upscale look, but cozy atmosphere. Food is really yummy - Loved the caprese salad and calamari. Scallops are so delicious, so is the veggie tortelloni (can't remember the full name). Portions are quite small - so appetizers are highly recommended to fill your belly. Tiramisu ranks below the average - I wasn't impressed, but I'm hard to please when it comes to that one. Wine selection is great. Perfect for fun, group dinners. Only four stars because of the tiramisu, and the decor - I'm more of a traditional, Sicilian, family kind trattorias when it comes to Italian.",5
"After hearing a bunch of my east coast friends rave about this place, I figured it was time to try it for myself. I probably made a poor decision with the buffalo chicken wrap after seeing the amazing looking sandwiches. The meat was all sliced fresh and they did a pretty good job of keeping the huge lines moving. My wrap was above average, but it's nothing that I would go out of my way to get. The person I was with ordered the turkey wrap and he said it was 'the best wrap' that he has ever had. I'll be back to try one of the fresh sliced subs and I have a feeling that I'll be adding another star to my review.",4
"First of all, Dana ROCKS! She was our server tonight and was so down to earth, friendly and accommodating. It wasn't really too crowded so we were all able to pull up chairs to a little table and hang out. Really swanky, modern environment and relaxed vibe. I was really impressed with the drinks and the food. Everyone had a really good time and they had a live DJ too. It was a really nice place -it was probably one of the better hotel bars I've been to. More of a club vibe than a regular ole hotel bar. I enjoyed my experience there!",4
"i like this joint its good.  check it out. prices are fair and the mini corned beef sandwiches were great.",4
"I've been here a few times, and I am for sure a fan! It's such a cool spot for grabbing drinks after work, hangouts, and yes, even dates. The service for the most part was great, except for that one time our server seemed to hover a little too much. No big, though. The food and atmosphere are both pretty fun, and there are plenty of TV's to keep the sport fans entertained. Very fun spot, I am definitely going back and would recommend that you do too!",4
"Again, a great pizza place with an extensive menu. If you're only in Chicago for one night, get the deep dish and you won't regret it. I know it sounds weird to have sauce on the top of your pizza, but it's easily the best item on their menu. I've gotten both take-out and eaten at this location, and the service is great, the portions are generous, and it was easily the best food I ate in Chicago (I ate there twice in five days).",4
"I've been here a few times: I ordered out once, ate once with a friend and ate and drank once with some co-workers.  All three times I was delighted with the food (although no one can make me eat my vegetables, they continue to serve them to me.)  Anywhere from a burger to a steak, this place has been always been above par.  Service has been below what I expect at a place located in the heart of the loop, but absolutely tolerable.  Drinks aren't that bad either.  There's usually a drink special, but I got a top shelf drink for $6 during happy hour.  I'd recommend this place for a night where one just wants to go for a bite and some lively conversation after work.",5
"I haven't been to this chain since the 80s and thought they had all closed down for some reason. In any event, the deserve 5*s for not only returning pretzels to normalcy (i.e. with salt) but for raising the bar to awesome new heights.   The deep-fried pretzel!   It is so fantastic.  I can't stop thinking of it. And you get three.  So good!",5
"Jamba Juice is as good as it gets. For a nice healthy boost, while you are on the go, Jamba Juice will always hit the spot. They have a variety of different flavors and shakes. They also have oatmeal and other items such as protein bars, granola, muffins etc.... This particular location is right on Michigan Avenue across from Millenium Park. I was running errands and happened to stop by for a quick fix. The staff was very helpful and very friendly. Plus, they were busy and I still got my shake in about 4 or 5 minutes. They even signed me up for their rewards program and gave me free stamps for future shakes. It was pretty awesome to say the least.",5
"ummm...awesome.  If you are used to light, greasy, cheap chain pizza...head over to Giordano's.  The atmosphere is as inviting as the food.  Have a drink or two and wait for your beautiful Chicago za to hop off of the farris wheel style oven onto your plate.  This Chicago stuffed pizza is loaded with cheese's from it's great friend Wisconsin.  The edge of the crust is a side dish...like a crispy on the outside chewy on the inside bread stick if you will.  And the cheese is so goey and chewey with quality ingredients sunken into the cheese like a goat skateboard in a mudslide.  The pizza is rightfully topped off with a deliscously bold sauce...adding the great touch of red sauce to bring it all together. It's hard to keep your eyes open while eating this...mmm",4
"Yes, Yes, Yes.... This location is the place to go.... Went there for a lunch outing with the coworkers and from the appetizers to the pizza, everything taste sooo yummy, fresh and good! Nothing was over cooked and that to me is the most important aspect when dinning in a pizza restaurant! Our service was good to. I was really impressed!",5
"They should have called this place Giordan-wow's. It made me wanna shut my mouth and slap my grandma.",5
"A lot of ppl told me to try Chicago stuffed style pizza when I go to Chicago. I did try it.. It tastes so good. I love the crust and we get to pick the topping we want for the stuffing;. Even though the wait is long, it worth it. We need to preorder the stuffed pizza for 45 mins ahead, so it give them more time to bake the fresh pizza. I am in love with Giordano's pizza. I won't be able to eat chicago style pizza as good as in Chicago.",5
"Tip: PRE-ORDER the SUPREME DEEP DISH!! My family and i came here on a trip to visit my son, who had just graduated boot camp.  There was a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon around 3ish or so, we were told we could wait or pre-order our pizza so it would be ready shortly after we were seated.  Best advice we were given that day! We were seated and our pizza arrived within 10-15 minutes.  One slice of this pizza is all you need and i love my pizza (new york style preferred) but this was amazing! I was so full and happy we ended up taking the left overs back to the hotel for a midnight snack!  Street parking may be tough, you can always park at the sears tower parking lot and pay the parking fee, it is so worth it!",5

"This has been the only place in the city where I've been able to find sweet and sour tofu.   While I wouldn't recommend eating in, this place is great to get in and grab a quick bite to go.  The outside might put some people off -- it's a small shack (that used to be a hot dog joint).  I've been in there a ton of times at all times of the day, and it's always clean and the people who work there are always friendly. The food is freshly made, and they're willing to take requests.  For $7 you can get a heaping portion of an entree, fried rice and either a crab rangoon or egg roll.   One of the best 'fast food' Chinese places around, and certainly a better value than some chain place like Panda Express.",5
"I am a big fan of Eleven City Diner.  It's one of my favorite spots in the South Loop. I brought my Dad in last week for Father's Day, figuring he'd be into the cozy, old school feel of the place. I had my favorite, the Woody Allen. I've ordered it so many times I didn't even have to tell our server what I wanted. Awesome as usual. My dad had the brisket because when the Brad the owner came out to say hello (he's always really welcoming like that) he was saying he'd just smoked the beef that day. We loved it. We loved everything. You can totally tell Brad puts the love in his food. I don't mind spending a couple extra bucks for a sandwich here at all. Its worth it! I promise! PS. You'll really have fun with the 1940s soda fountain feel. Sometimes restaurant owners that try this wind up mak",5
"What a great, new, awesome place to eat lunch in the Loop!  My co-workers and I had lunch there today, and it was my first time, but their third time.  They talked about Jason's Deli so highly that I had to try it out, and I'm really not into eating out at lunch when I live right across the street where I can make my own lunch, change into my pjs and lounge for 45 minutes before going to work.  It takes a special place to deter me from going home for lunch. I had The Great Rueben, and wow, it's an accurate title.  The corned beef was perfect, the sauer kraut was German goodness reincarnate, and the size made the price worth it.  I paid $11.38 for the reuben sandwich, chips, a long slice of pickle and a fountain drink plus soft serve ice cream.  The fountain drinks are $1.99 and all you can",5

"I now live in DC, and among the many reasons why I miss Chicago, Giordano's is one of them.  Every time I come home, I demand that my parents have a fresh hot Giordano's pizza waiting for me. There are a lot of good options when it comes to Chicago-style pizza (I'm also a fan of Gino's East and Pizzeria Uno... or Due) but Giordano's is hands-down my favorite.  I love the stuffed pizza concept and it comes out to an amazing slice of pizza.  I'm pretty simple when it comes to my pizza, so I usually just get the stuffed cheese, and I'm in heaven every time.  The crust is nice and hearty, so if you're still not full by the time you're done with your pizza (an unlikely story, but it's been known to happen) then you can easily fill up on that.  The cheese is warm and gooey and plentiful, and I c",5

I wish I was exaggerating but I'm not. The lines are retarded and the prices are stupid high and yet, I will blindly look past those two things for the Chicago Mix.",5
"I landed in Chicago yesterday and decided to pay a visit to a pizza joint, for what I heard was Chicago's best with deep dish pizzas. Anyway, with a pizzeria being a stone throws distant from home I decided to begin my Chicago experience with Giordano's! I ordered for a special deep dish with add on of Canadian bacon. It takes about 30mins for the pizza to be made so one can wait either at the attached bar or as I did, watched the pizza makers do their thing! It can be quite entertaining to watch them make those pizzas so gracefully! I was pleasantly surprised to find how huge the pizza actually is. Little did I imagine before ordering, that gobbling the pizza by myself was a joke! The portions are very generous and since they don't sell by the slice; you will have to buy a full pizza. The",5

Oh, and when asparagus is in season they have a special sandwich with it. One word to describe this place : Totallyfreakingdelicious",5
"Hate to be cliche and give five stars, but I can't think of anything wrong with this place. I was visiting friends who live in Chicago, and they took me to dinner here, saying it's 'The' Chicago Pizza. Went just before 7 on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy understandably - wait time was 30-45 minutes, but you can pre-order, so our pizza was ready almost as soon as we sat down - it was really not a bad waiting experience at all. We got a medium for us two girls and my friend's husband - she and I had two pieces and that is PLENTY, and her husband had 3 - I think there was even leftover, so don't worry about not being satisfied! Crust is flaky and nice, dough is perfectly doughy, and the cheese is great - (as far as I can tell) good quality mozzarella, and plenty of it, without being s",5
"Have I really not reviewed this place yet?? How could this be? I've been here only about 10 times and tried almost everything on the menu.   first of all, ECD has the best bloody mary in the city FOR SURE.  I ask for an extra pickle to be added to the meat+ cheese, olives, and celery that come standard with the drink. They are perfectly salty, savory, and spicy and do not taste too watered down or heavy.  it's just the perfect thing for a post-work out beverage on a Sunday afternoon. What have I eaten here?  Salads are large and chock full of goodies, the slider ruebens are not only bitesized, but aren't too messy and don't fall apart.  The Red velvet cake is UNBELIEVABLE.  Not only is it huge and 3 layered, but it has chocolate flakes and the kind of cream cheese frosting that has just th",5
"This is a top-of-the line dining establishment.  The restaurant is located high up in an office tower and has wonderful views of the City.  The food is fabulous and the wine list is overwhelming.  It's all great.  Pricing adds up to a bill that is likely larger than the annual budget of a small country.  Service is impeccable.",5

"First time in Chicago and first taste of true Chicago style pizza...Giordano's did not disappoint! The pizza was much better than I anticipated and was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of toppings and cheese. The doorman at our hotel recommended this over Lou Malnati's which is where we were originally headed...thought it be best to take a locals recommendation and boy, was I glad we did! We ordered a small special stuffed pizza and it was more than enough for me and my hubby. We left full and satisfied, but I was still talking about it and craving it before bed! Highly recommend for pizza, just know it takes approx 35 minutes for it to cook so enjoy some vino and salad while you wait!",5
"This is now my favorite Italian restaurant in the city. Amazing dishes in all categories. Try the mushroom pizza, the oxtail gnocchi. Great wines also.",5
"This is perhaps one of the best Pizzas that I have ever had. We tried the deep dish with two meat toppings. We had it delivered the first time we tried it and ate it in the second time. Both were phenominal! The delivery pizza was much better, because the sauce had thickened up and taken on a richer taste. We even ordered a few pies mailed to our home in the Kansas City area. The mail order was good but not near as good as in person. Love this place. I personally hated Chicago style deep dish until we tried theirs. I wish they had one in Kansas City! Can't wait to get to back to Chicago!",4
"I LOVE Garretts Popcorn- it's delish.  This location is much less crowded than the one on Michigan Avenue and just as good.  You'll still find a line but it won't be all the way down Randolph so it's not as bad as what you would expect.  Order the Chicago Mix- you can't go wrong.  Love it.",5

"Berry Fufilling- its true! I had this smoothie for breakfast, and I didn't want to eat lunch. I tried to go with a selection low in calories and lower in sugar than the rest, and this was the winner. I loved it! The only problem was they were out of raspberries, and so they used extra strawberries and blueberries. I didn't mind, but that's just a warning to anyone who is a raspberry fanatic. Hopefully it doesn't happen very often.  My friend was shocked when he found out I had never been to Jamba Juice. Now I can see why. I waited way to long! I may be a Jamba Juice regular now.",5

"Man, this place is damn good. I found about it through Yelp thanks to someone's handy list of places to eat for lunch downtown. It was kind of a hike from my office, but from the reviews I read I had a feeling that this place and I were meant to be. The entrance is a little tricky and I definitely looked like a rookie trying just to get inside (tip: go with the door that leads downstairs). Everything on their menu looks delicious, but I love the option of building my own sandwich so that's what I went with, and the person I was with had the 'Scottsdale' which was really just a Reuben. Both of our sandwiches were so good, the ingredients were super fresh and they made it all in a jiffy. The prices were also totally reasonable, our entire delicious meal (2 sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, and 2 ",5

The stuffed sausage is my favorite along with the stuffed Spinach also. Their thin crust pizza is pretty good as well. They have a bar if you are interested in having a drink.During lunch you can get a personal pizza to go which is always great if you are in a hurry, but you can't get it after 5PM.

Beware if you don't like smoking and have a social phobia. (strangely I hate smoking but it didn't really bother me & when I got home I didn't smell too bad) You will have to muscle in to get a drink if you get there after 5pm. I have not been in on a weekend but I heard its nuts (packed). If you are lucky enough to chat with the bar manager Mary, do so, she is the best! Her tales of her backpacking in Ireland are hilarious!",5

"THE BEST Chicago Deep Dish pizza... hands down.  I especially like the spinach one.  If I have out of town guest who want to try Chicago style pizza, I take them here. Now, there are some things you do have to note: 1.  If you are going to eat here, make sure that you like the person that you a going here with.  The wait for seating can be long.  If you are ordering a deep dish pizza, it does take 45- 1 hour to cook. 2.  See note above, do not stuff yourself on salad or drinks because 3.  One slice of deep dish pizza is a meal.  No, seriously.  All that cheesy tomato goodness is A LOT.  This is Chicago Style Pizza!!  This Pizza is thick and hearty enough to start a bar brawl. I prefer to go in the middle of the week. Too bad its soooo bad for you!",5
"First thing my friends and I did when we got to Chicago was find a Chicago style pizza, and luckily it was just across the street from our hotel.  We ordered the Chicago stuffed special pizza and it was as good as i thought it would be if not better.   We started out with a huge family appetizer that had like 10 mozzarella sticks, 10 wings, 6 chicken fingers 20 fried mushrooms and 30 fried zucchinis.  There was 5 of us and we couldn't finish the appetizer.  We had to wait awhile for the stuffed pizza, but when it came we each could only eat one.  We still had 3 slices that we just brought back to the hotel. We ate there again the day we left and I decided to try one of their philly cheesesteak sandwiches and I thought it was pretty good too.  And of course i had a slice of stuffed pizza.  ",5
"When I visited Chicago recently, I had only one thing on my mind - dang its cold!  Okay, the other thing on my mind was getting a slice of cheesy and thick deep dish pizza for dinner.  Staying at the Hyatt on Wacker, I braved the minus zero windchill to visit Giordano's on Lake Street.   I ordered a small deep dish with mushrooms and pepperoni.  It was soooo delicious!!  The waitress was charming and made the experience the best it could be with her friendliness.  I'd come back here again anytime .... and the small is plenty of food for two - even for three.  Two slices fills ya uP!",4
"Fantastic pie!  It was very busy, but we got seated about 30 minutes after we walked-in on a Friday night.  A deep dish pie takes about 40 minutes to cook.  The staff didn't rush us; in fact they were very attentive.  The food was well worth the wait.",5
"I recently took on the challenge of evaluating and ranking almost all of Goodwin's wraps over a 2-month period. You may notice that I have avoided most of the veggie wraps since I am a meat eater. I must say that all of the wraps, except veggie, are fantastic and I would gladly eat the bottom ranked wraps before I settled for Subway. Here are the ranks and findings: 1. Santa Rosa - Great for the winter. A very soft bite. 2. Key West - Great for the summer. Pineapple is refreshing. 3. The Vail - Great name. Basic BBQ. 4. The Flagstaff - Very similar to the Santa Rosa. 5. Nogales 6. Santa Fe - Boar's Head Roast Beef is so pure. Light amount of tomatoes. 7. The Tahoe - I was not expecting to like this one, but the turkey walnut salad was very good. The walnut taste shines through. 8. Caesar W",5
"I was shocked to see the mediocre reviews of Epic Burger.  Some friends and I stopped by Epic Burger on Friday night and everyone was RAVING about the food!  I had the Epic Burger Combo.  I love, love, love hand-cut fries and Epic Burger's did not disappoint.  Plus, there were plenty of them.   The burger itself was wonderful!  It had the uneven, slightly crispy edges that reminded me of a Steak 'n Shake steakburger.  Ordinarily, I shy away from 'special sauces' on a hamburger, but, for whatever reason, I decided to go with the sauce and I'm sure glad I did!  I got the egg bun.  Several of us were raving at how great the egg buns were.",5

"Fantastic food, fantastic wine list, cheese served at perfect temp, and stellar service.  We liked it so much we've been there 3 times in 2 weeks!  Also, other Italian restaurants in Chicago take note, this is how you serve olive oil, fresh and not rancid.  I can't count how many Italian restaurants I've been to in the last year that have had off olive oil.",5
"This is by far the best popcorn that I have ever tasted. The Chicago mix which consists of cheese and caramel popcorn makes my mouth water just thinking about it.",5

"Giordano's has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Eating it is an adventure. Know that it takes a while for them to make these pizzas, as they are incredibly deep, robust pies. Also know that you can't eat as much of it as you think you can. Down here in the South, I can polish off a whole frozen Dijourno's by myself, but I honestly can't eat more than two or three slices of a small pizza at Giordano's... three is pushing it. The drink list is decent. There is Guinness. This particular Giordano's has times when it is so busy that it's worth finding another location, but in general the wait times are bearable. Always worth it.",5
"Superb breakfast - greatly enjoyed the Challa French Toast. Novo Bagel & Lox was also a winner for my daughter. A little pricey but (as usual) you get what you pay for...",5
"If you visit Chicago, you must stop at Garrett. Be warned, once you start eating their famed Chicago mix (cheese/caramel), you will not stop. They pop it fresh daily and it will stay fresh for at least 3 days after your purchase, but it will probably not last that long. The portions they give are also very good for the price. A small (a little over $4) is typically large enough for 2 people to share with a little left over. I have not had to purchase anything larger than a medium (a little over $6) for a family of 4. They are centrally located all over Chicago (and in the O'Hare airport). They also allow online ordering, but it can get steep depending on the size you need. DO NOT check this on your way home if you want it to arrive at your destination. Note they won't tape or staple the ba",5
"I  had just gotten to Chicago and was looking to grab a bite to eat when a friend of mine Twittered to try Giordano's.  This location was on the way from my friend's condo to the ticket booth at Lollapalooza, so it seemed perfect.  I had been to Chicago a few times over the years for day trips, but had never experienced Chicago as a tourist, so this was my first Chicago deep dish pizza.  I get it.  We got a 10' stuffed pizza, half cheese for me and half veggie for my friend.  It was like a 45 minute wait til it came out, but boy was it worth the wait.  Just amazing, amazing pizza.  We split a salad before since we knew we'd have to wait awhile, so I only had room for 1 slice, but I devoured another slice later that evening at the condo.  This pizza was so amazing, I stopped by another Gior",5
"JAMBA JUICE POOL WRESTLING - undeniably the best creation since .....well, Qdoba (read that post for details).   You may have seen me there before.  I frequent their Michigan Ave location weekly, and you can often find me debating with the staff ......particularly about they rejecting my request for Stoli to be added. NICK'S FAVORITE:    CITRIS SQUEEZE w/ Power Boost  (although sometimes I request the Femme boost to put the girls behind the counter up in arms...hehehe)",5
"Tip: PRE-ORDER the SUPREME DEEP DISH!! My family and i came here on a trip to visit my son, who had just graduated boot camp.  There was a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon around 3ish or so, we were told we could wait or pre-order our pizza so it would be ready shortly after we were seated.  Best advice we were given that day! We were seated and our pizza arrived within 10-15 minutes.  One slice of this pizza is all you need and i love my pizza (new york style preferred) but this was amazing! I was so full and happy we ended up taking the left overs back to the hotel for a midnight snack!  Street parking may be tough, you can always park at the sears tower parking lot and pay the parking fee, it is so worth it!",5
"We go here at least a few times a month and the staff and food are great. In the style of the 'old school' deli with new flairs, (ie, old school= Katz's in NY, Kanter's in LA, rascal house), this place has a lot of character. I've noticed that a few people misinterpreted this as attitude...it is not... it is personality and comes with great food. The corned beef is a tasty standard, I'm a fan of the corned beef-pastrami hash (however, it doesnt work for those dieting); the lox platter is a favorite. Tried everything from omelets to burgers and all has been close to perfect. (i am quite picky and have high standards with my food as my other reviews show). None the less- hit up the bar, great bloody mary. If you go on a weekend morning expect a slight wait-- can be 5 minutes to half an hour.",5
"The 4 stars is for the ketel one Bloody Mary ONLY!! Its the BEST I ever had in Chicago. A must have for brunch. With that said, I live right around the corner from Jimmy Greens, so its very convenient. The food is ok, the wait staff is not all there. Go for the drinks, and to watch sports.",5
"The best popcorn ...and not just cause oprah says so .Ive been eating this stuff waaay before she made it cool .My mom has me buy bags of it and ship it to Puerto -Rico for her ...its THAT good !!",5
"I love this place! The yummy popcorn is moderately priced and very addictive. Unfortunately you cannot get this popcorn unless you order online or downtown. The Chicago mix is gooey caramel and cheese popcorn and believe you me, you will EAT every drop. Whenever I visit St. Louis I must bring a can to my family there. If you see the long lines, jus make sure you go ahead and have your money ready, and stay off your cell phone, they won't work with you if you are on the phone! It's worth the stay in line. It is sooo good it will melt in your mouth. Like I said, worth every buttery drop.",5
"HANDS DOWN, THE BEST POPCORN EVER. And I don't even like popcorn!  Thanks to Chicago Trolley and Double Decker Co., my family and I each received a free bag of Caramel and Cheese popcorn.  When someone recommended the Caramel and Cheese, I was really skeptical since I don't like caramel.  However, it's the perfect mixture!  Pop in one of each at the same time, and it's a great combination of sweet and salty.  SO GOOD.  Definitely worth the stop if you're ever in the area.",5
"Friendly people, very fast service, convenient location and delicious food.",5
"Everything about this place is superior. From the service to the food. Weekends mornings is extremely busy (no surprise), so be prepared to wait a bit. The decor brings you back quite a few decades, and the story of how the restaurant got started is fantastic.",5
"Ahhhh....This is my favorite pizza in the whole wide world. I go to a lot of Giordanos (including this one, Midway airport location and Franklin & Randolph) but have been to this one the most. The stuffed sausage is my favorite along with the stuffed Spinach also. Their thin crust pizza is pretty good as well. They have a bar if you are interested in having a drink.During lunch you can get a personal pizza to go which is always great if you are in a hurry, but you can't get it after 5PM. T This place always hits the spot and will always have the best pizza in Chicago! Mmmm Mmmm Good!",5
"I decided to try this chain during my first visit to Chicago, and their deep stuffed pizza did not disappoint. I was so full from only one slice that my family and I (3 of us in total) had to take the rest of the individual pizza (said to serve 1-2 people) to go. The service is friendly, but once the restaurant gets busy (by 1pm, the whole place was PACKED for lunch), the service is slow and frustrating. I don't blame the waitresses since they have to manage 10 tables at once, but with such a successful chain, you'd think the managers would hire some more help to please their numerous customers.",5
"The BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had, without a doubt. I know Giordano's gets labled as a tourist-y restraunt, but I am a Chicago native and no deep dish pizza will ever beat Giordano's for me (except maybe my mom's homemade deep dish). Nothing compares to walking blocks on a cold winter night and swooping in the revolving door with a blast of warm air and the delicious aroma of pizza. If you hate long waits, call in and order ahead of time or preorder and head to the bar. It takes nearly a half-hour to make your pizza if you're ordering a deep dish, never mind the long wait for a table. But it will all be worth it the minute you take that first cheesy bite. Every time I have visitors to the city, I always take them to Giordano's to have their lives changed, and they always leave happy.",5
"Here's how my luck goes:  a few months back, was walking aimlessly on Wabash with hunger pangs that were going to lead to some serious damage being done at the next reasonable food joint I saw.  So I see India Grill and went on to have a pretty subpar experience. Little did I know, the spot next door, Eleven City Diner, is seriously beastly with their food and no one had passed me the memo. I see what kind of friends I have.... Nonetheless, the food at Eleven City is unbelievable.  I got the Sam Levy Chicken sandwich. It was spicy, like I like everything, juicy and I had a lot of fun dipping it in ketchup. Special shot out to the chollah bread it was served on!  The bartender, Jennifer, was also extremely nice and informative and recommended I have a chat with a Dead Guy (its a beer. Hadn'",5
"Until a few days ago, I had never been inside Garrett's.  It was one of those treats that I loved but always ate when someone brought it to work or a party.  However, I wanted to bring something to Thanksgiving and there wasn't a pie shop in site. When I went in to order, I knew that it would expensive but I had no idea of the price. I ordered a 2 gallon tin and realized that it was $55.  Wowser. After paying, I realized that I could get 2 gallons in bags for $26.  Since my family could care less about the tins, I was hoping that they would let me change my order.  Since there was hardly anyone in line, they did.  Thank you!",5
"Yummy Yummy Yummy all in my Tummy....lol This is by far the best pizza I have had in my life.  I was visit Chicago for the 1st time in 8/07 with mom & sister. We were here to see my mom's side of the family..most of whom my sister & I have never met before. So..Giordano's was near our hotel that we were staying at. I had researched this place before leaving San Diego. We went to this place after seeing some our crazy relatives.  I have a good reason for calling them crazy...lol. But, I digress... My sister & I decided on the stuffed pepperoni & cheese which was heavenly.  The cheese just melts in your mouth and the crust is so buttery delicious.  It's was so good...that we took a pizza back home with us to San Diego on the plane. I'm just sad now because I haven't been able to fine a place",5

"Ghostbar is an overpriced and 'wannabe' swanky joint.  I went for a large social event where everyone was classy and spending big bucks, but we somehow managed to receive horrible service.  Our bartender, Dion (yes, I called him out) was super rude and clearly hadn't had any customer service training.  It was bad enough that the drinks were overpriced and very weak, but then to have Dion go off on me and my friends was the most uncouth thing I have ever experienced. This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous. I can only assume that is the reason the individual tipped lightly.  But, that was none of my business because my friends and I had been leaving hefty tips all evening. When I asked Dion for another dr",1
"The guys behind the counter are fast, friendly and efficient. The food is another story. The temperature in the store was WAY too HOT on a cool day in Chicago. I had the beef 'special' and was not happy with the beef that arrived. It was served on a small bun, was very plain (I had it without peppers or onions) and dry, and is just a plain small sandwich. I sometimes grab dinner at the Gold Coast stand at Union Station and the beef's are much larger and better ('juicier'). The fries were served unsalted in a large brown bag, and were hot and excellent in flavor and texture, the only issue is there were just not very many of them. The drink was small, and not enough for the dry sandwich that I had. There are tons of lunch spots around the location, and I wont be back to this one. Total - Be",1

"Dear Deep Dish Pizza lovers and aspiring Chicago Pizza Tourists: Giordano's is the McDonald's of Chicago deep dish pizza.  Their thin crust is doughy and bland.  The dough in their deep dish has way too much sugar in it.  If you like safe, conservative and tasteless pizza, you might like G's (see Pizza Hut).  But if you want flavor and quality, look to Gino's, Uno's and Lou Malnati's.   For some torturous godforsaken reason, the company I used to work for would order this shit over and over when there's Pat's, Aurellio's and Gino's nearby.   Btw, if you want some thin crust recommendations, PM me, and my answers will be mom & pop shops, not corporate crap.  Hmmm...let's exit this review with 'peace out!' (say it in Kip, Napoleon Dynamite's brother's voice)",1
"Ick. Ball of cheese. I went with three friends on a recent trip to Chicago and we all thought the pizza needed more crust, more filling, and more sauce; anything but more cheese! We all left feeling sad and confused- is that really what Chicago deep dish is supposed to be like? I've certainly enjoyed the deep dish I've had in other cities, including San Francisco, much better.",1
"I came here because of the great reviews on Chowhound, but I wish someone had told me the following:  At Giordano's you will pay $25+ for a small pizza that tastes like cardboard.  Literally, the pizza is cooked on cardboard.  This is a huge no-no for flavor and texture. Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable.  I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least.  This happen to anyone else? There has to be good deep dish pizza in Chicago, I just don",1
"OK.  We just got back to NY from Chicago last night and I just reviewed Glenn's Diner and Yolk (both very good) and I had to put my 2 cents in about this place too.  I saw Giordano's on TV and I have to say that THE PIZZA SUCKS here.  Even if I didn't think that NY pizza rules, the crust here was just awful and the tomato sauce tastes like the crap you get if you are dumb enough to order Italian food at a diner.  We went to Lou Malnati's a few days earlier and that was pretty good (for deep dish pizza, that is) as were the other dishes we saw people eating there.  Other people near us at Giordano's ordered other dishes and they looked just awful too (a plate of fried, really greasy looking appetizers, calamari that looked tough and hard).  I mentioned to my husband that I hoped that their ",1

"If I could have given 0 to 1/2 a star I would have. I had reservations for 7:15 for 10 people.  They called and asked me to pre-order our pizza which makes sense for any deep dish pizza place.  I pre-ordered our pizza and we waited for our party to arrive at the bar.  The bartenders were unfriendly and we had to flag them down for second drinks, did I mention the bar was not busy. Our party arrived we were seated and our waitress was oblivious about our pre-order.  We still waited over an hour for our pizza, what was the point of pre-ordering if we had to wait anyway. There were fruit flies all over the front of the house of the restaurant.  The pizza was not hot.  I know this is a tourist trap but my employees wanted to go here and I wanted to show them a good time.  I will never ever go ",1
"We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer.  The calamari  were small, over breaded, tasted mushy and left lots of bread crumbs on the bottom of the dish. I felt like I was at a crappy fish 'n' chips joint.  I started wondering if  professional chefs were cooking or just some dudes off the street. For the main course I had the New York Strip in a red wine sauce. It came with diced potatoes mixed with onions and garlic on the side. My husband had the Prime Ribeye that came with mashed potatoes. We were both very unimpressed. My potatoes were hard and cold. For a second I though I was eating a Stouffer's frozen dinner. The only good thing about our meal was the bottle of Chianti we ordered.",1
"I watched this joint being built and I thought 'good' another restaurant in the South Loop.  About time.   Then it opened. From day 1 the owner of this place has been a prick.  Not so much to the customers, but his employees.  He will give them a hard time - yelling at them or mocking them in front of customers.  He walks around like he's hot shit, when he owns a shitty diner in the South Loop.   As for the food.  Boring.  Bland.  Burgers are premade patties, most likely bought in bulk at Costco.   The only reason this place is still open is because not enough new places have opened.  Give it time and before long Eleven City will be gone.",1

"I ordered from this Edwardo's once and have never gone back since.  The deep-dish Spinach was horrible!  Something just wasn't right with the cheese, it was as if they mixed something really foul tasting with the mozzarella, I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but it just really gave the whole pizza an awful after-taste.  It's really a shame, I remember going to one of these years ago out in Elmhurst and thought it was fantastic.",1
"This place is unspeakably dull. Why would anyone want to go to--let alone frequent--a drab bar with a handful of boring beers and dreadful food? Oh I know.

Nary a menu item compels you to say,'I gues I wouldn't mind that.' Bad offerings all around. I gave in and ordered a panini.

The City's health inspector was there so people seemed on edge, but come on people, think and do something other than starring into space. Will not return.",1
"if I could give this place a 0, I would. after being told it would be a 45 min wait, it was really 1 hr., 45 min.any pizza lover knows the secret of a good pizza is the crust and cheese texture.  Crust like cardboard, cheese like silly putty.  it was obvious they and cooked the pizza early and reheated hit when we finally got to our table.we had the thin crust and it was still over a 1/4 inch thick.  veggies on one of our pizzas tasted terrible. others in our family went to another location and had the deep dish.  they were very disappointed too.will be sure to tell anyone we know visiting Chicago to never go there.",1
"I was in Chicago recently for a business trip. Unfortunately, I did not have much time to explore the city and the various fine cuisines it offers (Taste of Chicago 2011, here I come), but I was intent to sample the Chicago style deep dish pizza its so famous for. Now I've had deep dish pizza before.  Houston is a big, diverse town with transplants from New York and Chicago who open up restaurants and bring their local cuisine to our Gulf coast shores, so to speak. I've enjoyed the deep dish Joe's pizza (spinach and sauteed garlic with chunky tomato sauce) at our very own Star Pizza.   So, on our last day in Chicago, I convince my work mates that we absolutely must indulge in a deep dish pizza before we leave.  They acquiesce, but not knowing the town and being limited on time, we ask one ",1
"Ghostbar is an overpriced and 'wannabe' swanky joint.  I went for a large social event where everyone was classy and spending big bucks, but we somehow managed to receive horrible service.  Our bartender, Dion (yes, I called him out) was super rude and clearly hadn't had any customer service training.  It was bad enough that the drinks were overpriced and very weak, but then to have Dion go off on me and my friends was the most uncouth thing I have ever experienced. This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous. I can only assume that is the reason the individual tipped lightly.  But, that was none of my business because my friends and I had been leaving hefty tips all evening. When I asked Dion for another dr",1
"My family has been eating at Giordano's for over 25 years and  this location at Prudential Plaza has ruined my experience with them. My wife and I live in the loop and have had nothing but bad experiences with this location. A few of their servers are condescending and most of the staff treat us like tourists. A little over a month ago, we decided to go over to this location and have dinner, but the wait was over an hour, so we switched to take-out and waited for our pizza. It should have taken 40 minutes, but ended up being close to an hour and ten minutes before they informed us they had given our pizza away by accident. Instead of giving us a free pizza for the 2 hour wait for our pizza, they gave us 3 dollars off and sent us on our way. There was little apology for the mix-up. Once aga",1

It was due a little complain about the pizza we ordered. We order the veggie without broccoli and we get the pizza with the broccoli plus the 45 minutes to get the order completed. The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged.

"This has truly been one of the worst pizza delivery experiences I have ever had. I ordered a pizza at 5.10pm which of course doesn't arrive before the hour is out (whoever said Pizza was 'fast food' hasn't heard about today's pizza places). The thin crust pizza that arrives is overcooked to the point of the pizza crust being brown (brown cheese really?) and no salt or flavor on anything. I call to complain and of course they tell me I need to wait another hour to get a replacement. Clearly my displeasure doesn't matter to them because they know people won't wait that long. I also decline to wait but I want my money back. They agree to take the pizza and give me a refund provided its not been eaten.

The curry chips sounded so awesome - fries and curry sauce. I love the madras curry flavor and England is one place to get it. What we actually got was a different story - they served the fries next to a bowl of chunky potato curry that was not very saucy. We actually asked our server if she was kidding us. Did they expect us to skewer the curried potatoes with our 'chips'? I ordered one of the winter special drinks - called a cinnamon toast. It tasted like very watery (bland) cider. I don't find many places in the city that water down their drinks - because they normally cost you $10. The beer list was",1

"So i really like Jamba Juice, I had been raving about the Pomegranate Pick Me Up to my husband....he wanted to finally see what the fuss was about, because according to me it was 'just soooo goood'. So on a hot day downtown we decided to go in. Since I was trying to maintain my diet, I decided to get the Make it Light version, oh boy....for the next 5 hours I had the worst tummy ache ever. Not sure if it was this location, or the Make it Light that caused this, but I was not a happy camper. Also, this location was extremely slow - they had 3 workers (visible) and it took them 15 mins to take my order, and another 7 to make the 'tummy hurting make it light pomegranate pick me up' drink....",1

When I visited here the entire restaurant had one waitress covering all the tables @ around 5:30PM.  Granted there were only two tables when I walked in, but by the time I left (at around 7:30PM) there were at least 15 tables with only one waitress covering the whole restaurant.  Needless to say, the service was slow. Pizza itself is un-amazing.  Bland sauce combined with 'fresh' mozarella cheese and uninspiring bread.  If I were to make a pizza from scratch at home, my oven would make a better one.  I was hoping to taste the good 'Chicago-style' pizza, and what I got was something worse than Papa John's.

"Dear Deep Dish Pizza lovers and aspiring Chicago Pizza Tourists: Giordano's is the McDonald's of Chicago deep dish pizza.  Their thin crust is doughy and bland.  The dough in their deep dish has way too much sugar in it.  If you like safe, conservative and tasteless pizza, you might like G's (see Pizza Hut).  But if you want flavor and quality, look to Gino's, Uno's and Lou Malnati's.   For some torturous godforsaken reason, the company I used to work for would order this shit over and over when there's Pat's, Aurellio's and Gino's nearby.   Btw, if you want some thin crust recommendations, PM me, and my answers will be mom & pop shops, not corporate crap.  Hmmm...let's exit this review with 'peace out!'

Mountains of rubbery mozzarella cheese, no sauce, nothing good, let alone extraordinary! Crust sucked, veggies were soggy and droopy...meat was nothing special.  The tastiest part of the meal was the marinara sauce I had to order to dip me pizza in because there was just no sauce.

We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again.

It's expensive for what you get - you pay quite a bit of change for a huge plate of bland, sub par food. I've tried quite a few of their menu items - their pancakes are dry and spongy, their cakes are dry as well. I got fed up with the lack of quality in the food and the fact that my carryout order was almost always screwed up. The only thing I ended up eating there near the end of my 11 City stint was the cheese fries. Now, the cheese is good. However, they always managed to (somehow) screw up the fries. Cold. Burned.

We arrived at this restaurant and saw empty tables, so we thought a table for two would be easy. The manager explained that they did not have enough servers to service all of the tables, so we'd have to wait for a table. He said it would be a long wait.

I had generally liked the coffee in the past and the fact they have a variety of flavors. Though, I learned early on to never order the iced coffee. They keep a jug full of stale coffee in a fridge and serve it to you in a cup of ice. It's nasty.

Sadly, Everest was THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD at a fine dining establishment. In most cases, the server would set the food down, say the name of the dish, then walk away with NO explanation of the dish whatsoever!

"The only thing epic about epic burger is the hole it leaves in your wallet. I don't mind paying for good food. I don't mind paying for GOOD food. Why does my burger come out looking like someone ran it through the dish washer? Why is my bread not dry and fresh? Why do my vegetables look like they were sitting in a pool of their own sweat for hours? And why do my fries look like they someone just insulted their mothers and they can't do a thing about it? Poor sad dejected things. Now the taste is ok. It's not terrible. But what leaves me angry is that it could be so much better. With just a bit more care taken to put the food together you can have a wonderful burger. Especially with the ingredients that they use. For a place with food that isn't really epic, the service can make up for it. ",2
"Atmosphere is that typical wrought iron madness of all their other restaurants. We were in the private room in back for a work thing, which was nice, but not uniquely so. The food was underwhelming to say the least. My steak was over done and the accompanying barolo sauce was sticky and cloying. The potatoes on the side were straight up hash browns. In a blind taste test, I don't know that I could pick them out from frozen. I've never had a stellar meal at any of the KDKs, though they've all been reliably expensive and over-hyped. I'm glad other people have enjoyed their meals. Maybe I'll have better luck at Opera. . .",2
"Solid 'meh'. For what it is, it's kind of pricey. The menu doesn't jump out as exciting, and the food was just okay. Nothing special. Fries had no seasoning. Pulled pork was what appeared to be leftover ribs (Cubed - which is not pulled, FYI) with barbecue sauce on top. I don't mean to be a southern or anything, but it just wasn't really good. But the place was packed. Lots of white people. Older white people. I was wondering if they were all tourists, because CLEARLY none of them lived in the loop or South Loop - super suburbanite looking bunch. There are just so many better places to eat for cheaper. Capping it off was some awful service. My friend asked if there were any drink specials. The waitress blankly looked and said 'no'. My friend asked 'do you have a martini you would recommend",2
"I don't get it- deep dish pizza. It's really a lasagna but has layers of bread instead of noodles. And the bread isn't anything wonderful or distinctive- like a San Francisco sourdough, say. The regulars here know that there's a 40 min wait for the pizza to be delivered to the table from the time the order is placed. That's a looong time. I think it's an annoying affectation. You can go to the finest gourmet restaurant and order an item, and it's brought to the table fresh and hot a lot sooner. Think about it. A leg of lamb, a prime rib, an apple cobbler. The restaurant doesn't start from scratch when you order. Giordano's is a cult  and they've got diners believing that the pizza tastes better when they make you wait. The wait only makes you hungrier and you THINK the food is better than ",2

"Elephant & Castle has reasonably priced food, great beer, and a nice location for a quick business lunch. The food will be rated as just okay by most people, but it's decent for the price. The first two times that I went to Elephant & Castle the service was efficient, friendly, warm and above average! The third time that I ate there it took so long to get our food that we asked for a to go container with it, because my 1 hour lunch was over before any of our food arrived. The waiter apologized profusely, but that didn't fix the extensive wait. The decor is out of date, but it's not what I would classify as dingy or bad.

"Cute place, but the pizza just wasn't good. When you order it, your waiter will tell you it takes a long time to make a pizza, and you say that's fine. For the next 45 min-hour, your hunger grows while thinking of the awesome pizza you're about to stuff your face with. When they bring it out to you, the place it on the special pizza stands that all of the tables have, and serve you your first slice. My friend and I got the stuffed crust pizza with sausage.. while the sausage was really flavorful and REAL, there was just wayyy too much cheese and not enough sauce. I mean really, there was barely any sauce. It was like.... some bread, layers upon layers of cheese, and a spoonful of sauce on each slice. If you go here, avoid the stuffed crust!",2
"I really wanted to like this place. The food looked good, the decor was clean, but but! The service here just really sucks everything nice out. Our food was great, or looked great; however, our food came in warm, not hot. The Moshe Cristo looked delicious and my oatmeal came with brown sugar and raisins, so it's great for dieters. :P The kicker: my friend ordered a plain, non-toasted bagel with cream cheese on the side, and they got that wrong. When they served the rest of us was when the server asked her if she had a second choice for a bagel, because 11-City was out of rye. And then she ended up waiting several minutes to get her non-toasted plain bagel. Like people have been saying, the service is ridiculously slow and our server was not attentive.

"The hunt for stellar hummus continues with my experience at Jaffa Bakery today. With three middle eastern food restaurants in a two block radius, the competition is definitely stiff in the south loop.   Though Jaffa may not be my favorite choice, the one thing I've always liked about this place is also unique to their shop - the falafel plate mix. This is the menu option if you like it all - babaganoush, falafel, grape leaves, tahini sauce, garden salad,  tabouleh, and of course, pita bread, all on one plate, all for $6.75. The nice thing is, if you like everything but one or two of the options, you have the option of cutting that out and substituting a bit more of something you do like.

"First time in Chicago and I wanted the full experience so I figured my first meal would be a deep dish pizza. I head over to Giordano's because it is just around the corner from my hotel. It was a little after 4pm and the place was pretty empty, which is fine with me since I was on my own. From the start the service was subpar. Pretty much didn't care about my presence. I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out. The dressing is very very watered down. I have never had a caesar taste like that. There really was no flavor ",2
"In a word: disgusting This pizza COULD have been good, IF they cooked the effing dough.  Instead what I got was a pizza with a delightfully flaky outer edge, and a bottom that consisted of half cooked dough.  Nothing is as tasty as gooey dough, yum.  And it is 'stuffed' because they put another thin layer of dough over the top.  Then they put sauce on top of that.  So guess what other part of the crust is not cooked at all?  Bingo!  That top layer was so disgusting.  They at least put sauce on the pizza, unlike Lou Malnati's, but their sausage was not as good.  I did not like their chopped salad as much as the Malnati salad either. So Chicago, THIS is your idea of good pizza?  What a joke...",2

I thought the prosciutto was over salted and when my server asked how it was, I told him it was salty and he just said 'oh' without offering to remake it or give me another dish.

While I enjoy Einstein's bagels and its salads (one salad is often two meals), I have a big concern about this new location.  Mainly, its service.  The current set-up is inefficient.  Customers place their order with a staff person who enters it electronically.  You then move past the bagel display, attempting to avoid anyone who may be glued to the glass trying to figure out which bagel is calling them, to the register.  This is all of 5 feet away.  The person at the register says your name (because you've given it to",2

When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.'

"When friends offered to meet me for pub food in the area, I insisted on going to Exchequer after reading the positive reviews here about their pizza.  What a mistake.  My friends tried to warn me.  I wish they'd been more specific.  Something like, 'The pizza is great if all you want is cheese, cheese, and more cheese.' Crust?  Here's a pad to keep the cheese from sticking to the pan.  Sauce? Not sure, maybe it got lost under the cheese.  Toppings?  Well, the cheese did have a sausage-y flavor.... Now, don't get me wrong.  I like cheese.  The pizza wasn't awful.  It just was out of balance.  Badly.",2
"What a waste of space in the loop!  This place was a let down in every possible way.  We had to ask 3 times before our teeny bopper brought us glasses of water, and we had to hunt down our own napkins and silverware.  Huh, get bent!!  The only thing half decent was the warm pretzels and mustard appetizer.  If not for them, this place would only get 1 star.  Our entree of Chicken/Veggies with Penne pasta was terrible.  Don't bother with this place.....",2
"In fairness, I'm a New Yorker.  I won't belabor this point, but in short, Pizzeria Uno's has better tasting crust.  The pizza that is placed in front of you is beautiful.  It is cheesy and crusty and you have great expectations, but if you like crust with taste, not like an extended cracker, you may not like this style pizza. The place was packed and came highly recommended, but I wasn't impressed.",2
"Love the popcorn - could do without the workers!!  Do, I really have to listen to your silly conversations.  Less talk, more weighing and bagging please.  This applies to all the locations that I have been to!!",2
"Most likely due to its prime downtown Chicago location, the prices are too high for what they are selling.  I ordered two Chicago style hot dogs, fries, and a Mountain Dew for $7 & change.  The dogs were of low quality - the meat had little taste, and the toppings left much to be desired.  They were skimpy on the tomatoes, the relish was an unnatural neon green color, and they put way too much celery salt on it.   Save your money and treat your stomach by skipping this place and going to Clark Street Dog instead.  Their hot dog toppings are deliciously fresh and they charge less for it.",2
"The decor is nice, don't get me wrong, but that's what you're paying for. The decor. This place is listed as a '$$' here, and that is probably a very shallow-end estimate. A glass of Fuller's London Pride ($6.50), and a glass of wine ($9.00) set me back nearly 16 dollars. The evening was further proof that good company and good conversation is what really matters, and can make a great time in the a less-than-great place. I don't consider myself a cheapskate in the slightest, but $16 for two drinks is a little steep if there's no liquor or food involved. The service was hit or miss. The greeter was attentive and got us seated right away, and a server was right with us, but on a slow night, I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes after I get the bill before I pay, and I shouldn't have to walk ha",2
"If you want a really good deep-dish pizza with better servicing go to Uno's/Due's or Connie's. This stuff isn't nearly worth how much they charge for it.",1
"after hearing that the must have food for chicago is pizza from giordano, i left this restaurant a little disappointed. the serving size was huge and there was more than enough pizza to go around, but i can't say if i will ever specifically eat at giordano's again. the pizza was just alright... however, i guess you just have to have it for the complete Chiago experience.",2
"Regrettably, I have to say this place is bland bland bland. The beef in the burger is bland. Even the fries are soggy and bland. At least add pepper to ur fries!!! Visually,  you think the burger is going to be something special (lots of veggies and a juicy looking beef patty) but you are disappointed. I ordered the combo meal with a burger, whole wheat bun, and havarti cheese. Id prefer even Culvers over this place. Add more flavor to the burger and you will have something special. I do give props to this spot for ecofriendliness and a hip atmosphere. If every Mickey",2
"I kind of dread going in here but it's the closest bar to DePaul and a lot of the MBA students come here after class so I find myself here from time to time.   I have never had the food so the 2 star rating is purely based on the seedy patrons that also frequent this place. The bar always has a ton of 'professional drinkers' - even in the afternoon.  They are typically very loud and have no qualms about shouting obscenities across the bar.   They do have a decent selection of beers but I really wish that there were other options in the area.",2
"After having had an awesome experience ordering from Lou Malnati the night before, I decided to order similar dishes from Giordano's for a head-to-head comparison.  First up, it's the fried calamari.  While Lou Malnati's version was sublimely tender with a fresh tasting cocktail sauce; the Giordano's version was tough and soggy, and the cocktail sauce tasted every bit as being poured from a bottle. Giordano's is known for it's stuffed pizza, but the minimum size was 10' versus 6' at Lou Malnati's.  It was too much pizza for one person, and I was underwhelmed by the top and bottom crusts (which is what makes it 'stuffed').  If the crust is good, then one is more than enough.  And Lou Malnati's version also came out ahead in the pizza category for me.",2
"Deep dish pizza is on my top favorite foods to eat, and Giordano's is famous for having great deep dish pizza.  I have eaten here a few times, because their individual lunch deep dish pizzas are quick, inexpensive and they fulfill my need for a pizza fix. Why do i give them 3 stars only?  For starters, the service is terrible.  Each time I've gone to this location, our waitress was rude and slow.  The ingredients are mediocre quality and the price for a regular pizza is not worth the cost. 1 large pizza will run you about $30+.  For that much money for pizza, I want great quality ingredients.   There are other great deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago.  I'm open to suggestions on which to try next.",3
"Ok....so the pizzas are huge, make sure you order appropriately. Their 1-2 people will feed two people easily, even if they have large appetites. The pizza itself...well it's good. Very cheesy, nice enough sauce. Didn't love the crust though - a bit too pastry-like. I have had better stuffed pizza other times I have been to Chicago, but this was very good and I definable enjoyed it, so would be a fine introduction to the genre if you are close by. Go good, not great. As others have noted, the stuffed pizzas take 30 mins or so to cook, and a long time to eat as well so not fast food!",3
"This place gets a ton of hype but afterwards you're going to need a ton of pepcid.  The deep dish is their signature product, but its a huge gut bomb consisting mainly of mozerella cheese.  This place def. caters to tourists and gets pretty busy.  Skip the line and sit in the bar.",3
"I would give this 3.5 stars.  I have to admit that I am biased in writing this review since I'm not a huge deep-dish pizza fan, but I wasn't impressed with Giordano's.  Maybe it's too much hype, but I just didn't find it to be that tasty.  Too much tomato sauce, too long of a line.  Really nothing that distinguishes this deep dish pizza over other pizza joints. I did like how they take your pizza order before you get to your table, so that the pizza is practically there when you sit down.  Good for the hungry customers and good for restaurant turnover!",3
"I went after the sox playoff game (WIN!!!) and it wasn't crowded, thank goodness, because we were STARVING.  We sat at the bar because we waned to watch the red sox/angels game on the tvs.   The Flatbread was really good, but  the nachos were sitting in grease and really soggy. I had just a caesar salad as a meal and it was fine (they give you a lot of croutons if you are into that sort of thing), my dad got the stew which was not too salty, had well cooked noodles, and great veggies in it--not too thick at all.  He ate all the meat so I can't comment on that. The staff was friendly, they ambiance was nice, but after a bears game and a sox game, the bathroom was less than stellar.",2
"This loft space was transformed into an awesome diner that evokes an air of Jewish New York. From their bathrooms to their booths, 11 City Diner's got flair and kitsch to spare. Uh, if you go to a self-declared NYC style diner, you order the NY items. For dinner one night, I was in the mood for a bagel with cream cheese and a Brooklyn egg cream. The waitress looked at me a little funny when I asked for a chocolate one and said that was the only kind they made. Umm, Vanilla egg creams are really good too. And for the skeptical, there's no egg in it. it's chocolate/vanilla syrup, milk, and seltzer. When I am old and decrepit, I will have my IV drip of coffee replaced with egg cream. yum. And not that Hershey's crap. I'm going to have U-bet. Look it up. Anyways, the egg cream was a little ble",3

"Yes, Giordano's is always Giordano's - famouse Chicago deep dish pizza. It IS tasty! But the service in this place... Why do the waitreses NEVER smile? Once we had a party, and I ordered catering from this location of Giordano's. I came to them, and they didn't even have a catring menu... But the catering by itself was ok, all the guests enjoyed it.",3
"This is not a dig to this particular store, but a beef that I have with Jimmy Johns in general.  Where are the freaking pickles? I'm astounded by this. It keeps me up at night. I'm convinced that Jimmy John's is just a front for a spy organization that will be the demise of us all, because we all know it's un-American to serve a sub without pickles. And a big fat pickle on the side is NOT the same.  What am I supposed to do- lob an entire half pickle on my sandwich?  If you ask me, it's adding insult to injury.  Because you know they have pickles there but they won't slice them right.   Otherwise their sandwiches are dece, but I'm too busy flying into a fit of rage every time I get one because they don't have pickles!!!   I think I should go lie down now.   xoxo",3
"Epic burger is like (insert name of the first restaurant you think of with thinner, griddle made patties) with better ingredients basically. Good Bacon. Nice, soft bun. Great fries (until they get cold, but really, when isn't that the case?). Unfortunately, the burger itself fell short compared to my expectations. It was ok - first I'll qualify this by saying that I'm not a big 'thin' burger fan. If I wanted that, I could end up getting it for a whole lot cheaper at a place like Culvers (2 Burgers + Extra Toppings + Fries + 1 Drink = $26 at Epic). For that amount, I could have sat down at a restaurant and ordered my burger between rare and medium rare. (Note: I'll assume the risk of undercooked beef; I just want it to taste good). Also, I love raw onion on a burger, but the onion was overp",3
"I love pizza but I like them deep dish style. So when I got to Chicago, deep dish pizza was on top of the priority list. Getting lost on the street of Chicago, my friend Kathy and I came upon groups of hungry people waiting to get seated outside Giordano's. We immediately decided that this is the place to try! The hostess adviced us that we should order after 45 mins of waiting. Hungrily, after 45 mins, my friend and I ordered the Antipasto Salad and a smallest size pizza, 10 inches stuffed spinach pizza. After that, we waited another half an hour, which meant we waited an hour and half for pizza. Starving as I walked to the table, I thought to myself, this better be good! The Antipasto Salad came with imported ham, Genoa salami, Provolone cheese, black olives, red onion, pepperocini peppe",3
"Great smoothie, love the fact you can customize it with heallthy options such as protein, energy, vitamin boost, etc. I love the high energy in this location because I usually stop in a smoothie with an energy boost after burning the midnight oil. The only reason I'm not giving them a 5 is because recently they started asking 'would you like a this or that to go with your drink'. If I wanted sometihng else I would take it... I'm just not a fan of places that try to upsell you. They should just stick to their bread and butter.",2
"I think Gourmand has the same owners as Filter in Wicker Park, because it looks just like it on the inside with the chalkboards and stuff.  Also their menu is very similar.  The have a nice selection of tea and the food is good.  I like the sweet potato fries.  Also, the hummus is the spiciest I've ever had, which is a good thing.  Definitely recommend it.  My only gripes with them are that they only take cash (just like Filter they have that weird ATM system) and that they only serve food until 9.  It'd be great to have a place in the South Loop to hang out and grab a bite later at night.",3
"I showed up with a group of 14 people on Chicago Marathon Sunday.  They very kindy put 7 tables together for us on the sidewalk.  The waitress was fantastic.  She did a great job taking care of such a large group. The beer list is great and has many selections.  The food is British Pub Food, it is pretty good but it is the pub atmosphere and the beer that draw me to E&C.",3
"I mean, it's just not my thing.  I'm used to dive bars and jukeboxes.  The place was nice and small and very chic.  ALOT of business people too.  They have a martini menu and I ordered the pomegranate one.  It was very good.  Tried the chicken pizza too, that was good.  I came here for a mixer, the atmosphere was nice and I liked the lighting.  The martini was $10.   It seems like a good place to meet after work if you work downtown but it was kind of trek for me so I may not be coming too far into downtown to have another martini.",3
"Yeah it was A-ok and tried coz everyone suggested that I should check out deep dish pizza - the signature item of city of 'Revolving doors'.. Took about 45 minutes to get our special small sized deep dish pizza.. Lots of mozzarella and less meaty.  Fried zucchini was heavenly.  Would suggest the appetizer platter if you are a big group.  Tried their pizza and got out with their Tshirt as a souvenir :-)",3
"Bleckh! Not like this is the restaurants fault but the patio has go to go! Sitting there listening to the screetching and squealing of the train going by 10 feet above my head every 3 minutes was like listening to fingers on a chalk board. Well, why didnt we just sit inside, you ask? There was a wait and we were in a hurry. To add to my experience that wasnt off to a good start, I ordered Guinness Stew and was accidentally served a big pile of poo. They tried to disguise the look by sprinkling some chopped tomatoes and green onion on it. The first and only other time I had Guinness stew was in the originating country of the dish; Ireland. And it was good! tender juicy, melt in your mouth pieces of beef mingling in a hearty sauce with tender root veggies all served in a crock. What I got at",3

"The food was good, but the service was ok.  I say this because my friend and I came here on a weekday for breakfast and it was only 5 tables filled. There were 2 servers working the tables, yet the service was super slow...Don't get it!! I can't imagine how it would be on a weekend when they are packed with a wait of 45-1hour. I'm going to try it again, hopefully I'll change my thoughts.",3
"I was going to the Chicago Theatre to see a show and wanted to grab a quick drink and a snack.  I just happened to see a meter spot open up right in front of E & C.  It was a busy Saturday night and the bar was full, so we sat at the bar.  The crowd was a conglomeration of out of towners and others waiting to see some shows.  I had the meatloaf, my friend the chicken plank appetizer.  They both were just ok, the taste of the food being nuked put me off a bit, but the great bartender and the 15 yr. Glenlivet put me back on track a bit.",3

While on some plastic chairs outside, Brad walks up to two flamboyant guys who were unlocking their bikes after being patrons of this establishment, and yells at them for parking bikes. 'Can't you see the sign I paid good money for, NO BIKE PARKING?' Great way to treat your customers... Owners mom, was awesome, friendly. Brad, was scattered, didn't walk us directly to the table, mind in a million places. We were seated right nex",3
"So ever since we moved our office from Wabash to Michigan Ave, I haven't been back here. But why am I choosing to review it now? Because I really miss the veggie burgers they used to have once upon a time, which were a total 5-star and my lunch for 2/5 days a week! But, all good things come to an end - yes, even good burgers!! They changed chefs or something, who in turn changed their veggie patty and now it's a very mediocre burger. I do still think their salads are okay, nothing special, but I have nothing else to make the 3-block hike any more... :(",3

"This Gold Coast Dog is pretty good, and the first one I ever went to. Really, really tasty burgers (have to love a place that tops their burgers with classic hot dog toppings, pickle spear included) and mediocre fries. I do enjoy the Merkt's Cheddar squeezed on, and the burgers are always pretty juicy, thanks to perpetually soaking half-cooked in a broth bath. The dogs are okay, and the beef is 'eh.'  The latter being a little flavorless and the the former being burnt to a crisp more often than not. I understand and embrace the 'char' aspect, but they go a little overboard here. The knocking aspect of Gold Coast Dogs is that they are brutally inconsistent from store to store. The Wabash location is worlds apart from the one in Oglivie as is the one out in the 'burbs by O'Hare. It seems the",3
"So I work nearby so we go here a lot for lunch and it's OK.  They have really large wraps and the Lisa's Wrap is pretty good.  I don't like their salads though- they just don't taste right to me but the sandwiches are decent.  They have tons of choices too and it's kind of hard to narrow it down to one- and I'm still searching for something that I love there.",3

The salsa, guac and chips that came with it were completely whitebread. The downstairs space is unique with a cozy dining area. Portions are big and the price is reasonable. I'll give them another try perhaps but probably not too soon.",2
"From the vintage Chicago travel posters to the stuffed pizza model upon entering to the friendly waitstaff to the lively dining area with a Cubs game on several televisions - this was a fun experience and a very good dinner.   Having already tried Geno's East, Uno's, and Lou Malnati's by the time my family and I went to this Giordano's location (near the Hyatt Regency where we were staying), I have to admit I was a little 'deep-dished-out (yes, it is possible).'  Well, fortunately for me, this isn't technically 'deep dish,' it's Stuffed Pizza.  'Semantics,' I said - and dove into Giordano's Supreme with a 312 wheat draft beer (a local microbrew selection).   Crust was a bit crunchier than I'd like AND (I can't believe I'm saying this): the pie was almost too big.  But the 'toppings (I supp",3
"We were in Chicago for a wedding and opted to do Chicago-y things while we were there, hitting up Michigan Ave and Navy Pier.  We stopped in Giordano's for lunch because it's a classic Chicago meal.  It was just ok.  We waited for about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad, and we had to wait about 35 minutes for the pizza, but understandably that's because they have to bake it. The toppings were skimped on, but it was good.  It just wasn't great and something I have to rave about.  I mean, I like cheese and all.  Being from Milwaukee, we get a bad rap about putting cheese on everything.  For the record, we did NOT come up with pizza stuffed with an extra two pounds of cheese. After about 30 minutes to an hour, the extra couple pounds of cheese you consumed will catch up with you in som",3

"Don't judge me for the fact that my reviews of late have been about pizza joints. I eat other things, I swear. So my verdict for Giordano's is---not as good as Lou Malnati's! (But better than Gino's East). I appreciated the pre-order option here (we ordered while waiting, so by the time we were seated we only waited 10 mins before our pizza arrived). But the pizza itself was overwhelming, our mushrooms and olives were smothered by the cheese, and in general it felt like way too much. I realize that deep dish isn't meant to be a 'light meal,' but I feel like Lou Malnati's finds the perfect ratio of ingredients to cheese to crust for a deep dish pizza.",3

My friend ordered the Mahi sandwich which was good but the plate was covered in the sauce from his cole slaw.  The side caesar was chinsy for $6 - iceberg, parmesan and dressing.   Service was hit or miss. Sometimes she was on top of it and sometimes she was missing in action.",3

The wines we ordered (both red) were also a little overpriced, although I know now that the price of a wine glass at restaurants is typically the price of the bottles themselves when bought at wholesale by the restaurant. For desert we shared an order of tiramisu which was excellent. The service was a little too attentive, particularly at the end.

Nothing really stood out about this pizza: sauce was ok, cheese was ok, toppings (well, fillings) were ok too. It was just ok. It got the job done, we walked out full but I definitely didn't have the 'WOOO, I just had the bestest Chicago-style deep dish pizza evAr' feeling that I was hoping to get.

I didn't like the crust - it was hard and had the texture of an apple pie crust instead of a crispy pizza crust.

Many of us had either the Corned Beef & Cabbage dinner or Corned Beer sandwich and all seemed to enjoy our meals. The high note of the lunch was when I saw that my favorite beer from Ireland (Kilkenny) was now being sold in the US. I could have left lunch at that point and been a happy camper. I would recommend E&C for a lunch time or post-work drink in the Mag Mile/Loop area.",3

Burgers and wraps with regular appetizers like quesadillas. The food is nothing special, but really hits the spot if you're hungry and in a rush to eat. The food always came out quickly and well prepared. My main problem with Elephant & Castle is the wait staff. I went about half a dozen times and had a different waiter/ waitress each time. You would think that at least one of them would have given us good service, sadly that did not happen. Each time our waiter/ waitress forgot something, the silverware, the drinks, our appetizer. It wasn't terribly busy any of the times I went, so the mishaps can't be blamed on an over ",3

The Veggie pizza was not so fascinating though. I felt full after just one slice. So we had the rest of it for to go. Surprisingly, when i reheated the pizza in the microwave the day after, it tastes much more delicious than when we ate it at the pizzeria!

It was her bday so I didn't want to put up much of a fuss but the food is just alright. Its nothing to rave about however the chicken sausage is very tasty hence why I didnt change the star rating.

Waitresses made sure were attended to, but we didn't want food as we had just come from the Taste. We just wanted drinks before we headed to the AMC. I went the Ralph C route and got a pear flavored Magners cider. it was ok, I guess...LOL! Like last time it took a little while for the drinks to come out. Tip from the waitress: If you are seated close to the sidewalk on the patio and you back is facing the street, do not let your bag or purse hang on your chair as shady individuals walk by and will snatch and run.",3

I really think the owner messed up by opening in this area because he's missing out on lots of us who would be eating here every weekend, but don't have a car to get to Eleven City Diner. My friends and I cabbed to try it out, but it's way too far to do this all the time. I thought the food was really good...I was very exited to have some good jewish deli food!

"The pizza was OK. We went to Ginos East and tasted what Chicago, deep-dish pizza was supposed to be. Had we not gone to Gino's, Giordano's would probably be a 3 1/2 stars, but now I realize how badly they miss the grade.",3
"Beer selection was poor, made worse by running out of 2 on tap selections. Very loud in dining room, so hard to have a conversation during the 45 minute wait for the pizza to be done. When the pizza came, it was really good, but be careful not to over order unless you can take it home.",3
"Went here for two occassions. Once for Mother's Day and another time for a benefit.  I'll start with the Mother's Day experience. We were there before the dinner rush, so we had attentive service. Our waitress was very sharp and friendly.  The food was good. Mom enjoyed it! :) The benefit experience...that was a little different.  The staff was rude. The party room was packed and they probably should have offered us a bigger room or consulted with the hosting the party about the number guests.   I would still return to the Emerald Loop for lunch or dinner again.",3
"The meal started off well... Gioco was able to fit my friend and I in for a quick dinner (our original choice of Eleven City Diner was closed for a private party) before we saw Mama Mia at the Roosevelt Theater. By the way, it's here for another week and SO good!! You'll have 'dancing queen' stuck in your head for weeks- fun times. My friend and I decided we'd split an appetizer, but between my allergies and weight watchers diet and her pregnancy diet there wasn't much on the menu for us to split.  We finally decided on the fried calamari, which isn't so weight watchers friendly, but my friend is pregnant with twins so I figured I was up against 3.  My friend may be eating for 3, but I did quite a good job of polishing off that delicious fried calamari with her. As for the main meal I deci",3
"My first experience involved me walking in and immediately walking right back out... But I came to find out they actually have a veggie burger after writing Johnny Rocket's. Veggie burger is fantastic, and so are the fries! Best of all - it's vegan! If you're not into mustard make sure to tell them to make it without cause they slather it on!",3
"It's a british pub, with a continental selection of beers, with a splash of N. American beers to boot. Great to watch sports, and relax with friends, but that's what it is.  Enjoy the wood finish and the service.  This pub is par for the course.",3
"I love giordano's but this one just doesn't cut it for me. I came here a couple of month's ago with friends who have never had giordano's before. The waittress was kinda snotty but I really didn't care cuz, I wanted some pizza so her attitude was irrelevent to me. But my friends sure had a problem with her that's why her ass didn't get a tip (hehe) I don't tip rude people ever. But on to the pizza we got half pepperoni, half beef  all I have to say about that was what happenened to it? All we got was globs of cheese and the pizza was lukewarm. But it was ok I've had better giordano's it's not how it used to be back in the day, but I like the one by midway airport  they never fail me.",3
"5 stars for the food and atmosphere and about 2 stars for the location. I really think the owner messed up by opening in this area because he's missing out on lots of us who would be eating here every weekend, but don't have a car to get to Eleven City Diner. My friends and I cabbed to try it out, but it's way too far to do this all the time. I thought the food was really good...I was very exited to have some good jewish deli food! The owner came over to say hi and he was nice in an obnoxious way.",3
"Giordano's is my pick for best Chicago deep dish pizza. The cheesy deliciousness cannot be accurately described in words; it is truly something that has to be experienced firsthand. Once we arrived at the restaurant we were informed that there would be an hour wait which seemed a little confusing because there were lots of empty tables and this added to the all-around disgruntled feeing of the group but we decided to wait it out. The hostess staff at this particular location is not very pleasant but once we were seated our waitress was very nice. The wait was only 20 minutes or so. For the eight of us we ordered two large pizzas, one pepperoni and one sausage, and an appetizer sampler filled with an assortment of deep friend things. They call their pizza stuffed, not deep dish and it's mor",3

"There is a history here.  A history of restaurants that have catered to the business and tourist crowd alike over the many decades that a restaurant has occupied this space on Wabash.   Exchequer, however, kind of left me feeling flat the other night, but maybe they were just having an off night.  My regular haunt in this 'neck of the woods' is Millers Pub located one block north so when I wandered in here, it had a pretty high benchmark to hit as I like Millers. There were a couple of hiccups along the way.  First, when we we were seated, no one came to take our order.  I finally flagged down a person who ask who was our server and she said it was her.  So we placed our order for a pizza and a couple of drinks. She said it would take 30 minutes for a pizza trying to suggestive sell us an ",3
"Have you ever been hungry but when you were trying to decide what kind of food to eat, nothing really sounded like it would hit the spot? This place is kind of like that... The menu is huge, but it's kind of all the same, and nothing on it is particularly interesting or special. Don't get me wrong--the portions are good, and it's all pretty standard breakfast and diner fare that tastes just about what you'd expect. The atmosphere is nice--it's clean and kind of old-timey, and the service is just fine. It's a fine place to grab a sandwich or some pancakes and eggs. It won't blow you away, but it's ok. You will leave full. And later on that day, if someone asks you where you had breakfast/lunch/brunch, you'll probably struggle to remember the name, what you ate, or where it was, but you'll r",3
"Came here for a light dinner and drinks with a vegetarian coworker.  Bad choice for a vegetarian. We ordered a share plate of sweet potato fries, pub pretzels, and veggie spring rolls.  (Don't even get me started on why Irish & British pubs serve Asian food...).  All the apps were pretty meh, but I stuck with vegetarian items to be nice, so maybe that's not a fair assessment. The Big Ben Brownie made up for it, simply delicious. Stella drafts were on special for $5, which was nice. Nice decor and great staff; our server Raheel was always there to ask if we needed anything.  We definitely overwelcomed our stay, but he was nice to check in on us once in a while after dessert. Convenient location; I'll have to give it another try with some carnivores.",3
"I think if you are in town and staying in the Loop, you should have at least have one dinner at Giordano's....specifically the stuffed pizza with your own toppings on it.  I had the Personal Cheese Stuffed with pineapple and Canadian bacon. The service was not overly amazing and we had to get the attention of the front desk that no one had waited on us for near 10 minutes after we sat down (it was the lunch hour) I was also bothered that the wait staff brought out water, then proceeded to simply leave the water at our table to serve ourselves....and the tap beers were like sampler size...super small.  The server?  I don't think she cared one way or another about much....kind of impersonal. The stuffed pizzas take about 35 minutes to make, and they are good to let you know in advance of thi",3
"I showed up with a group of 14 people on Chicago Marathon Sunday.  They very kindy put 7 tables together for us on the sidewalk.  The waitress was fantastic.  She did a great job taking care of such a large group.

"Came here on a late night whim on a very, very cold Chicago night. The nachos were pretty good, drinks were strong, but I was surprised at how empty it was, I guess its more popular with the after work crowd. There's nothing new on the menu here, but its a good option and nice additon to the Loop...certainly beats the chain dining that tends to dominate.",3
"I read some of the less-than-spectacular reviews, and lowered my expectations accordingly. This was my mistake, and one of the perils of relying on Yelp too much. I had one of the best breakfasts I've had in Chicago here. The Benedict. Get the Benedict. It's a large slab of maple-glazed pork belly, cooked to fork-tender, on a slab of crumbly, delicious cornbread, with poached eggs (of course) and a brown butter hollandaise, in which I think I tasted a little citrus. This dish is divine. We were among the first customers of the morning, and service was warm, friendly, and quick. It looks like they get very busy later on weekend mornings, and I've already seen lines of people waiting outside.",4
"Gioco is a great option for dining in the South Loop!  I've been here several times for dinner &  brunch and have never been disappointed.  You can't really go wrong with anything off the dinner menu, but some of my favorites are the gnocchi, tortellini and funghi pizza.  The filet medallions with gorganzola are great as well!  For brunch I MUST recommend the Banana and Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast because it's AMAZING!  Their roasted potatoes are delicious and come with any of the egg dishes (I think); my boyfriend enjoyed the eggs benedict.   You really can't go wrong at Gioco!",4
"Cavernous and noisy, this is sort of the physical and spiritual brother of Miller's Pub next door. I prefer this place, and as I maintain to my Ginos and Unos and Giordanos loving friends, I think their pizza is actually better. In fact I would rate it as one of the better pizzas in this pizza crazy city. Dark, old school, middle aged waitresses who are probably all named 'Flo,' and who call you 'Hon,' its all here. Busy, so yeah you may wait. Come with some friends and watch a game and just chill. Had a friend flip out on hallucinogens here once, so I have a sort of wistful nostalgia for the place.",4
"This deep dish pizza is the way pizza should be. None of that thin crust stuff! None of that stone oven truffle-oil and wild mushroom West Coast pizza! Every bite was delicious. I would have put in five stars but for the fact that the crust was unmemorable. The decor was kitschy, but I love that. They just needed to add some candles melting in Chianti bottles and some Frank Sinatra to complete the experience.",4
"So I decided to have dinner with a coworker on a Thursday night when an opera happened to be playing. We walked up and down Wacker trying to find a restaurant without a reservation. Finally we came to Emil's and I was surprised it wasn't more crowded. We were able to sit in the bar, which was misleading because there were a handful of tables and booths in the 'bar' section. The service was very good and the specials that night were all appetizing. I settled on a shrimp and asparagus risotto (if you read my reviews you will notice my love of risotto) :) My coworker had lamb. Both meals were very tasty and the presentation was beautiful. We had a great bottle of Cabernet and a simple, delicate piece of cheesecake. Overall a good meal.",4
"My fiance and I live in the loop and love this place as our 'corner' bar. It's a great location to watch a game be it baseball, football or basketball. If you're going to eat there, I highly recommend their pizza. It's perfect bar pizza but it actually has delicious flavor and you can tell how fresh it is by the way it's cooked and the toppings. They have a full bar there but I would recommend sticking to beer. Their cocktails aren't as inexpensive as they should be and are sometimes weak. Their beer selection is pretty good though and they sell pitchers which is always a plus in my book. During a commercial break, be sure to observe the people around you. The regulars in this place are like characters from 'Cheers' or 'The Simpson's'. Definitely a great people watching location!",4
"I was told that this was the best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago, so you know I had to go. There are about 30 locations in Chicago, so finding one nearby was easy. They have every type of pizza you could imagine from thin crust to the Chicago style deep dish. I opted for the Chicago classic deep dish. BTW, I now know why they call it a PIE. After waiting 40 minutes for my freshly baked pizza/pie, I cut into this thing of beauty. Cheese and toppings oozed out (it reminded me of a chocolate lava dessert with the warm center pouring out). I couldn't wait a minute longer, I tried to pick up a piece and barely made it to my mouth...MMM, this stuff was good, real good. I loved the texture of this pizza. There is crust, then toppings, then crust, then toppings again. A double whammy of deliciousness.",4
"as far as the area goes, Eleven City is probably the best diner food. Its kitschy Jewish grandma feel pretty much works for someone like me who is searching for a deli/home fashioned meal type joint with reasonable prices. The service is mixed, I've encountered young ladies to be divine waitress' while had an old disgruntled male who was far from what I wanted in a server. it's a toss up but I suggest sitting at the bar if you can bare the cramped space. the french toast is where its at. problems with eleven city: no deal on a dozen bagels. they charge over a dollar per bagel, which is absurd. really.",4
"Good loop bars open on the weekends are hard to find - Emerald Loop is one of them.  I went on a Saturday night, and was really surprised the place wasn't packed because it's a quality restaurant/bar! I was craving wings, and got plump, golden Teriyaki wings for $10, along with a Sierra Nevada (they have a beer special every month) for $4.  My bf got the chicken marsala for $13, piled high with chicken, carmelized onions, and fried gnocci with savory sauce.   The good service, and college football playing on 5 screens were an added bonus.  It might become a weekend favorite - I need to check out their hot and curry wings first.",4
"As my first trip out to Chicago, I knew I definitely had to hit up a deep dish pizza spot. Giordano's is very close to the Fairmont Hotel so we took a short stroll on a Saturday night around 8:30pm. The wait for a party of four took about ten minutes; not bad. The restaurant is classic and spacious. One look at a medium deep dish pizza and the boyfriend and I knew we were going to order a small. We had sausage and jalapenos, a very scrumptious combo. After two slices each on a small, we still had two slice leftover. It takes about 30-40 minutes for the pizza to bake so prepare on waiting. But so worth it. Every bite was yummy till I couldn't take another.",4
"Always a classic!  I like it better than Gino's, and it's a lot quicker to get in!",4
"Homey, welcoming place to spend some time having a meal and a beer.  I thought the atmosphere here was pleasant, dark enough to make you feel like it was okay to have a drink and relax, and homey enough to make you feel that you were sitting in a pub in England.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich, which was pretty good, and some sweet potato fries (which are hard not to be good!); but they also had some good comfort fare on the menu.  All in all, it's a nice place to enjoy a casual meal and beer on a cold night!",4
"Went on a zero degree night, and the stuffed pizza was amazing. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for our deep dish to cook. It was probably the most filling meal I have ever had, but it was worth it. Goes great with a nice cold beer.",5
"So everyone told me this is the first place you gotta hit up when you get into town.  When we arrived the wait was 45 minutes for a group of 2 and then the pizza would take an additional 35 minutes to make.  We were pressed for time as we had show tickets on the other side of time so we opted to order it to go at the counter in the back.  We ordered a small special stuffed crust.  It was plenty to share between 2 people.  The 35 minutes was legit and the pie was ready for us when we stepped back inside.  It cost 15 for the pizza. The pizza was good, def nice to try a real chicago deep dish.  I wasn't totally blown away though.",4

"How do I love thee, eating locally sourced noms beneath a sea of George Nelson bubble lamps?  Be still my midcentury modern heart. I'm still not sure if the burger really warranted the 'epic' moniker, but it was a tasty, fresh melange of texture and flavor.  Loved that I could hook up the havarti cheese, and the hand-cut fries were hot and crispy.  I also enjoyed a cool cup of fountain root beer with my meal. I really wanted to get the fried egg on top, but decided to stave off a heart attack for one night. Overall, it's a tad on the pricey side, but I suppose I've come to expect that from Chicago burger place.  In addition, the local/fresh thing leads to expectations of quality, and an associated price point.  Epic Burger has the green thing down to a T--they even have biodegradable utens",4
"I've been here a few times, and I am for sure a fan! It's such a cool spot for grabbing drinks after work, hangouts, and yes, even dates. The service for the most part was great, except for that one time our server seemed to hover a little too much. No big, though. The food and atmosphere are both pretty fun, and there are plenty of TV's to keep the sport fans entertained. Very fun spot, I am definitely going back and would recommend that you do too!",4
"This place should be paying me because I am constantly dragging people there with me, telling friends about it, hyping it up. It's right by my work and I cannot stay away. I have been to both locations and they are both equally awesome. This place is what fast food should be. They are about as close to being organic and sustainable as is possible and I applaud them for it. All in all, I am a BIG fan! The only reason you don't get 5 stars is because the beef isn't grass fed. That would put you over the top and until then this is my form of protest.",4
"Gourmand Coffee & Tea is much more charming than the Starbuck's I seem to live at these days. The vanilla latte I had here this morning was worth breaking my no coffee New Years resolution. For those of you who never carry cash in your wallet (like me) it may be helpful to know that they don't accept credit cards at Gourmand, but I guess that's part of the charm.",5
"Best known food about Chicago is their deep dish Pizza. Oh, did I mention this was the best pizza I have ever tasted? I must admit I am a big sucker for Cheese but this pizza was cheese heaven. when you slice into the pizza and pick it up the strings of cheese are endless and you must saw it off into order to finally claim it on your dish. I had pepperoni with jalapeno and it was all very wonderful! It's definitely a good experience with a long 2 hour wait. But this pizza was literally deep in cheese.",5
"Wow, you Chicagoans don't play around when it comes to making uber-thick pizza!  Six of us newbies showed up at Giordano's and ordered three medium deep-dishes and appetizers.  We were famished so we figured half a pizza each... Oy, the menu wasn't kidding when it said each pizza serves 3-4 people!  By the time we were done, we'd only finished half of what was on the table and our eyes were rolling into the backs of our heads.  I lost my deep-dish cherry to the spinach and special, and I'm still having foodgasms thinking about it.",4
"Good place and great food.  Last time I went there I actually got a $50 gift card to use over at Opera (one of their 'sister' restaurants).  Both places are great.  At Gioco they have FANTASTIC Calimari along with some nice desserts as well.  My only complaint is that some of the tables are too small but otherwise very highly recommended.",4
"This is my second review in as many days. Since their deep dish pizza made me a believer, I couldn't resist trying their ribs. Actually I had their BBQ ribs and chicken wing combo with waffle fries. Years ago I had ribs from Carsons and I was disappointed because they were not fall off the bone. Well the ribs at Exchequer did not disappoint. The ribs were fall off the bone. And although the BBQ sauce was tasty, I have had better ribs before at Smokey Joes in Aruba.  Still they were much better than Carsons. Now for the wings. They were dry wings, not buffalo like I am used to with a side of blue cheese.  These slightly larger than usual wings came with a side dish of the same BBQ sauce as the ribs. Come to think of it, it's probably better then mixing with blue cheese, but by the end of my",4
"Awesome Pizza. I've been here but my wife hadnt. She fell in love and she isnt a huge pizza fan (I know, but she's beautiful so I put up with it ;-)). The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the location that they put us. It was too close to the other table and I kept having to move anytime someone got up or when staff cleaned the table. The Pizza was worth the hassle however.",4

"I come here a few times a week because it's such a close walk from my office and they are pretty quick. $2 for bagel and cream cheese. They have tons of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from, my favorite is a toasted onion or garlic bagel with chive cream cheese. I just went here to get lunch the other day for the first time and got a half dark half white meat turkey sandwich on a french roll with 'the works'. It's real turkey too, that giant carcass just lies in front of ya waiting for you to devour it. They also have tons of juices and smoothies, but I find that it takes long compared to how fast they get food out. $4+ to use plastic.

"'Epic' has a special meaning in the soundtrack of my life. Rather than the dictionary meaning, I can still see the vinyl spinning round in those bluish-purple colors on the living room stereo beneath the 70's hanging globed light. As a kid, it was a close as I could get to a mirrored disco-ball. Epic, of course, meant 'Epic Records' home of the former Jackson 5 singer whose name I shared. Dancing at home on Friday nights, I pretended to be living 'Off the Wall' & wondered what it would feel like 'Working Day and Night'...ooh Lawd.

This is one of those Chicago foods that I'm glad I didn't pass up after moving here! However, this location drives me nuts. There's not enough room for the amount of customers who come in here, and then people get confused as to what they're supposed to do sometimes. If you're by the Randolph location (on the corner, right next to Oriental Theater), that location is the bee's knees. Huge, ridiculously clean, and the employees don't seem like they hate you for coming in.",4
"Has some really good deep dish pizza.  I feel like I've enjoyed the filling better at other places, and this is going to sound kind of weird...but I was really impressed with the crust.   Normally, when I get deep dish, I can't even eat the crust because a lot of places either can't keep it from getting soggy or try to prevent that from happening but just end up making it way too thick.  However, the crust here was perfect - not so thick it couldn't be cut through yet still crunchy and flaky even after the 15 minutes it took me to finish my piece.  Thumbs up.",4

"I love the atmosphere in this place!!!  it's sooo.........euro.  =) also, I thought of Cheers when I was here.  very cute....think wood and stained glass. my lunch date got the meatloaf that came w/ red skin garlic mashed potatoes (very good!) and REAL green beans.  I got the castle club w/ the english chips (seasoned french fries).  Very good food and atmosphere, average service.  I will be returning!",4

"Fun place to stop.  We wandered around a good mile looking for Garrett's and we stumbled on this location.  You can smell it about 1/2 a block away -- and the employees were really speedy.  The caramel corn was outstanding.  Pool boy got 'The Mix' (caramel and cheese) and I was less impressed with the cheese -- it left my fingers pretty dang oily and yellow.",5
"Simple place Good Burgers and Sandwiches Gets busy for lunch and happy hour Decent prices for the loop I hear the Pizza is good Some of the wait staff sucks Overall the best option for this type of place in the area",4
"My fiance and I live in the loop and love this place as our 'corner' bar. It's a great location to watch a game be it baseball, football or basketball. If you're going to eat there, I highly recommend their pizza. It's perfect bar pizza but it actually has delicious flavor and you can tell how fresh it is by the way it's cooked and the toppings. They have a full bar there but I would recommend sticking to beer. Their cocktails aren't as inexpensive as they should be and are sometimes weak. Their beer selection is pretty good though and they sell pitchers which is always a plus in my book. During a commercial break, be sure to observe the people around you. The regulars in this place are like characters from 'Cheers' or 'The Simpson's'. Definitely a great people watching location!",4
"This is a refreshing place for lunch.  Fresh, wholesome ingredients.  The wraps are unique and wonderful.  A lot of unique flavor combos.  All include chips and salsa, the chips are so fresh and the salsa spicy.  A FULL meal for the money.  The lines get long at lunch, but they move you right through.  Seating is plentiful.  There are numerous meat free options, and honestly you will not miss the meat.  This a must try for lunchers in the area.",5
"This stand has several names: Big Pho, Green Apple, Korean BBQ, etc. haha, they need to consolidate the names for their own sake. I had to enter in the address of the food court so that I could figure out how to write a review for this place. I'm not a connoisseur of Pho or Vietnamese food in general (as the other reviewers seem to be), but I do know good, hearty soup. This place has it and its cheap too. I think all the Pho runs between $7 and $9. I plan on trying the other stuff on their menu, but for right now, the cold weather place I'll be hitting up for delish Pho is Green Apple/BigPho/Korean BBQ Grill ;) The staff is  great and so polite. I've yet to have a bad experience here.",4
"First of all, Dana ROCKS! She was our server tonight and was so down to earth, friendly and accommodating. It wasn't really too crowded so we were all able to pull up chairs to a little table and hang out. Really swanky, modern environment and relaxed vibe. I was really impressed with the drinks and the food. Everyone had a really good time and they had a live DJ too. It was a really nice place -it was probably one of the better hotel bars I've been to. More of a club vibe than a regular ole hotel bar. I enjoyed my experience there!",4
"I started to salivate as I typed in the name of the damn place!.. I always get the Turkey burger on wheat, everything( minus tomatoes), grilled onions & blue cheese.. best damn turkey burger ever graced upon these lips of mine... I took the 1 star away because, like the other person mentioned, it is bright as hell in there & is expensive & sometimes the music in there is painstakingly loud..$10 for a burger,fries & a drink.",5
"The value here is great. The food was good relative to the price. The staff is friendly and the ambience is pretty cool. Next time I might try the brick oven pizza...i think thats what they were making. For some reason I had overlooked this place many times on my way to Opera or Zapatista and this day I decided to try something new and i was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't say there is anything special, but if you want a good solid meal in a nice place then give them a try.",4

"So Good!! As a member of the tribe myself, I am always excited to check out various Jewish Delis/Diners in the Chicago area.  This one really blew me away. As I awaited my table, I was literally drooling over the dishes I saw around me.  When we finally sat down (about a 25 minute wait for mid-day on a Saturday, not terrible for the area) I decided on the roasted vegetable sandwich, sub cheese fries for the salad, because really, they just sounded right. Sandwich came out on this delish foccacia bread and had pesto sauce spread on it.  My only complaint was the too-think slice of roasted onion on the sandwich - it was just a bit much for my taste.  Much to my suprise, and delight, the cheese fries were cheddar cheese fries!  So tasty, gooey, and heart-cloggingly excellent. My friend went t",4
"I have been to this italian restaurant a few times over the past six years and I would still go back. I find the food to be okay, but I dont think its worth the price. Sometimes I found it hard to find something on the menu that sounded great. The service and atmosphere have been very welcoming. With so many great italian restuarants in the city, this is one of the best. I will be back, no doubt. People who love wines of all price points will love Gioco if for no other reason than Gioco understand the importance of cool reds, chilled whites and cold sparkling wines.",4
"Lou's or Giordano's? Tough call.  I love Giordano's stuffed pizza better than standard pan pizzas from Gino's.  Well, I love pan pizza too... and thin crust too. Ok, I love pizza period, but Giordano's is my favorite of the thick, tasty style pizzas.",4

"I'm not going to lie, I actually prefer JJ's to PB's.  I support the double digit sandwiches across the board, on all issues the 7-grain bread is quite filling, making for a delightful one-course meal.  I like the use of alfalfa sprouts and avocado spread, very neocentric.  A bit pricey but in the middle of the afternoon you won't have to be reaching for that 3:30pm snickers or stealing various candies off your co-workers desk when they go to the bathroom, but if you still want to... go for it tiger.  Lines get long so get there early because each sandwich is spread with care before it is wrapped in white paper and sent to a better home.  Seating is scarce, so I suggest you sit on the floor.",4
"Being a burger fanatic, it was only right and a matter of time that Epic Burger and myself became acquainted. Stopped in today for lunch and noticed there are 7 Epic rules on the wall once you get near the register. I am usually good @ following rules so I read them and proceeded to the register to order. I asked the 2 cool brothers behind the counter what would they recommend and they told me 'the Epic Burger combo'. They also told me I could add toppings such as a fried egg and bacon. I definitely added the bacon & eggs along with cheddar cheese (other options were blue cheese and something else). I also had the option of wheat and white bread...I chose wheat. The combo came with fries and a drink which came out to $12. The burger itself was pretty good, but because I had everything you ",4
"My friend and I arrived in Chicago on 6/23 and were looking to grab a relatively quick late dinner around 9:00. We walked from our hotel and happened upon this new Gino's East location on our way to a different restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised to be able to get a table right away with no wait. The atmosphere was really nice and our waitress was really friendly. We appreciated the variety of craft beers available. I have enjoyed the chicago style pizza at other Gino's East locations during previous visits to the city and this one was no exception. We had the deep dish margherita pizza which I really enjoyed.",4
"I came here with my guy for the $1 sub day. This was my first time trying them and what better day to try than $1 sub day. There was a little line, but we were in and out of there about 10 minutes. Subs are good, but not the best I've had. Very quick service.",4
"The food here was great! Pro's- - Food is definitely better here than any other 'diner' in the area - Wait staff was pleasant and attentive - The decor was very nice and classic Chicago diner style - Good sized menu with good variety & presentation - Desserts looked delicious Con's- - Owner was a pushy jerk.  Certainly makes you feel like you outstayed your welcome as soon as your table is clear - Expensive.  $11 omelettes and $13 burgers. - Could have long lines",4
"I love breakfast and I love good breakfast places, this is definitely a good breakfast place.  I had to try their fried chicken and waffles.  Such a simple yet odd combination.  I still like Roscoe's in LA but Eggy's did a pretty good job with the dish.  Fried chicken was really crispy and good and the waffles weren't soggy.  They have small buckets of different kinds of hot sauces so I tried all of them with the fried chicken, habanero was my favorite.   I really liked the benedict which my wife ordered too.  One of the few times I liked it when I had to finish her food.  pork belly on cornbread with the eggs and their special hollandaise sauce.  I wouldn't mind ordering that if I come back here but they have some really good looking items on their menu still.",4

"I love real fruit smoothies...so this is the kind of place I would be all the time.  My big problem is that they just cost too much for my liking.  I would never become a regular customer on that alone.  I can't help but feel that $5 for a cup is just not worth it.   I came here a couple times cause they had a promotion for $1 oatmeal.  I tried all the flavors I believe (banana, blueberry, and apple cinnamon).  I think the best was the blueberry cause it mixed so well together.  I think the worst was the banana cause you couldn't really blend the two together.  I practically had to eat all the bananas to get to the oatmeal...whats the point in that? Of course the drinks I had tasted great, it is just the price tag that scares me off.",4
"Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal of the day.  No doubt about it.  That said, that's the only meal I've ever had here, but it's never been anything but great.  I've also had their cheese fries, courtesy of my roommate, and they are also excellent.  (I love my cheese fries, btw.)   The atmosphere is great, and a totally different from the standard breakfast staples of Yolk and Bongo Room in the South Loop/Printer's Row.  I love the diner feel, and the general theme of the menu.  I've heard great things about the sandwiches, but I've never personally had one.  The fountain soda option also makes this place a winner.   I'm keeping a star for myself because the host staff and management can be a bit off.  Wait staff is always on point.",4
"There may be a wait everywhere else but you never wait more than 10 minutes at Eleven City Diner. The food is nothing amazing but its always good and the service is always great. I do know that I love their french fries. Their only downfall is that they call themselves a Jewish Deli, but they are not kosher. This was a slight issue when I had family in town.",5
"This particular JJ's really does operate by their motto (subs so fast you'll freak).  It was a regular lunchtime spot for my co-workers and me, and once you have 'regular' status they'll know you by name and have your sandwich waiting basically the second you walk in the door.   Service here is really good especially for a fast food place.  They're all so friendly and have great attitudes, especially the Steve lookalike (of SATC).",4
"One of the downtown outposts of a Chicago institution!  They'll give you samples if you ask... and it's all good! The ones with nuts are sweet and decadent (and they come in nicer bags), and the Chicago mix is unbeatable (and makes a great gift for someone picking you up from the airport!) The fact that the sports tins are $3 more is pretty ridiculous.  Otherwise, it would be 5 stars easy!",4

"The pizza here is excellent and one of the best pizza places I have visited. The deep dish pizza takes about 35 mins to bake but it's worth the wait for sure. Each slice is about equal to 2 slices of 'regular pizza' and my wife and I weren't able to finish the medium pizza. There are layers of cheese and toppings, you might even have to eat part of it with a knife and fork. Try it and you won't be disappointed.",5
"So I was totally tipped off my a co-worker that I had to stop by Garrett's before coming home. I have to thank her for the tip! Yes, it's a bit of a tourist trap and you can't really sit down and snack while you are there but the popcorn is good! Tried the Chicago Mix (cheese and caramel together). Good but not my fav. Love the traditional caramel but the highlight had to have been the caramel with cashews! Although the apple cider was also pretty tasty. Might have developed diabetes while I was there. Worth it!",4
"Hate to be cliche and give five stars, but I can't think of anything wrong with this place. I was visiting friends who live in Chicago, and they took me to dinner here, saying it's 'The' Chicago Pizza. Went just before 7 on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy understandably - wait time was 30-45 minutes, but you can pre-order, so our pizza was ready almost as soon as we sat down - it was really not a bad waiting experience at all. We got a medium for us two girls and my friend's husband - she and I had two pieces and that is PLENTY, and her husband had 3 - I think there was even leftover, so don't worry about not being satisfied! Crust is flaky and nice, dough is perfectly doughy, and the cheese is great - (as far as I can tell) good quality mozzarella, and plenty of it, without being s",5
"If I'm in the mood for a great sandwich for lunch I go to Jersey Mikes. Their food is so fresh and they cut the meat right there in front of you. I love the #13 Original Italian that made Jersey Mikes famous. It has provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni (As you can tell I love meat!) I always make sure to get my sandwich Mike's way which adds onions, oil, vinegar and italian seasoning. Jersey Mikes is the place to go for a fresh sandwich that will be sure to fill you up.",5

"Garrett's, oh how I love thee! Whenever I am off the Jackson Redline stop, I cannot resist stopping in. Much of the time, there is a long line, but it is worth the wait. The staff is quick and friendly. Yesterday, I decided to try the caramel nut mix along with the regular large cheese corn I usually get. I find I prefer quite a bit more cheese corn in my Chicago mix, so I do it myself. It can get a little pricey, but this is one treat to try for sure. Cheesey, caramelly goodness. This is what cheese and caramel corn was meant to taste like. So satisfying! One of Chicago's, and life's little treasures. If you're visiting Chicago, it's a must have.   And then go visit the amazing architectural monument that is The Chicago Public Library main branch just a few yards away at 400 S. State on t",5
"My first pho experience happened to be here. Not sure if this is a good place to start for this wonderful dish but it just happened that way. I was walking down Mich Ave with a certain lovely lady, and pho was brought up,  and Yelp brought us here. The food court location (entrance is located on Lake right next to the McDonald's) made me a bit skeptical at first. The portions were pho-nominal and it all tasted great to me. I particularly enjoyed the brown sauce that it came with (similar to teriyaki) for mixing in. Bean sprouts and Asian basil came on the side. I enjoyed my first pho experience here. Now I will be searching out the next best place to get it in the city as winter is upon us. Truly warms the soul.",5
"This location is a hidden gem in the windy city. We were walking around the city and decided to have pizza. We called ahead to the other location near the Sears Tower and they said they didn't take reservations so we called this one up and they took our pizza order and by the time we walked over, the pizza was ready and we were served. It was sooo good. One slice goes a long way!",5

"Oh baby, thinking about the deep dish makes me hungry right now. I can still taste the tomato sauce, the cheese and the yummy delicious crust. My friend and I made a point to stop here after doing the museum and shopping...it takes about 35 minutes to cook a small deep dish and we waited patiently. Our server in the bar was super cool and was kind enough to take pictures for us. The pizza totally lives up to the hype. It's damn good. We ate here around 445pm....but we only ate one slice each because we had 930 reservations at Charlie Trotters....such good pizza to go to waste. So, knowing that we wouldn't eat the rest in our hotel later, we boxed that baby to go, just to give it to a bum outside somewhere. Sure enough, as we walked out and walked towards Michigan Ave a bum asked 'do you ha",5

"I loveee Giordano's deep dish & to all my fellow Chicagoians i know, i know it's very anti-Chicago to eat at chain restaurants but before you curse me and make me move to the suburbs i've tired every pizza place in my neighborhood & for deep dishes they make it best perfect dough and they put the toppings under the cheese like a true deep dish.  They are a little pricey for pizza but you gotta pay sometimes for quality.  If you come to visit check it out",5
"Giordano's is still my favorite deep dish pizza.  I've only been to this location once, and got take out since my hotel was just around the corner, so I can't comment on the wait staff.  I did have to wait in the takeout area for about 10 minutes.  Apparently my timing was good, since there were a group of guys in the bar that had more than 1 singing lesson, and broke out in song.  It even drew out some of the staff in the kitchen to listen. Getting back to the hotel, I got to enjoy what I consider to be the best deep dish pizza I've ever eatten.  Of couse like a dummy, I ordered a large for me and my wife, and we weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Good thing this pizza taste good the next morning cold for breakfast.

There are a lot of good options when it comes to Chicago-style pizza (I'm also a fan of Gino's East and Pizzeria Uno... or Due) but Giordano's is hands-down my favorite.  I love the stuffed pizza concept and it comes out to an amazing slice of pizza.  I'm pretty simple when it comes to my pizza, so I usually just get the stuffed cheese, and I'm in heaven every time.  The crust is nice and hearty, so if you're still not full by the time you're done with your pizza (an unlikely story, but it's been known to happen) then you can easily fill up on that.  The cheese is warm and gooey and plentiful, and I c",5

Prices are extremely reasonable and the beer list rocks.  I tried an oatmeal stout and a banana bread beer which actually tasted delicious-and just like it's name.  Sounds crazy but sooo worth it. All the food is served in HUGE portions which is incredibly generous considering the low prices.  We tried a 'side' of waffle fries served in a massive bowl and completely amazing.

The service is never bad in my experience and I like the atmosphere, very Italian. They have a lunch special too which I always get , you get a salad or soup, your own indvidual stuffed pizza, and a can of pop for like $7 bucks.

Ordered the Veggie deep dish to go cause the place was packed. It says it's enough for 1 - 2 persons, I'd say you could even split it with 3 people. The pie was a lot thicker than I expected. Soft crust, super saucy, lots of filling, and real cheesy. Definitely one of the best slices I've had in my life. I'm coming back to try the thin crust, hope to see you again soon Chicago..",5

"Favorite Jamba Juice ever. There is always a large group of people waiting off to the side for their smoothies, which always scares me into thinking there's a long wait, and I may not need that smoothie after all. But I do need that smoothie, so I go anyway. Even though there's tons of people, I've never waited more than five minutes. The workers are always super friendly and talk to the customers, but it doesn't slow them down or get in the way of them doing their work. Plus, whenever I ask for the recipes to be changed, they never pause or give me weird/angry looks; they just do it how I want, no questions asked. Also, unlike other Jamba Juice locations, their blenders work. I don't get large chunks of fruit and ice, but an actual smoothie. Yum.",5
"This was my first trip to Chicago and we were recommended to come here. The cheese was gooey-ooey-yummy. I was pretty much stuffed after one slice. It was super thick and the crust was delicious. I absolutely loved it. The staff was nice and organized. Prices were reasonable, and the wait really wasn't so bad, especially because it was Lollapolooza weekend. I have eaten at Pizzeria Uno here in San Diego which sells deep dish pizza and I actually like their crust better, its so buttery flakey...so I'm at least happy we have that place on the west coast as well.",5
"It's expensive and horrible for you, sort of like heroin.  And once you've had it, it's hard not to go back.  Like heroin.  Echoing the words of Becca B., the cheese/caramel mix will change the way you look at popcorn.  It certainly makes the sad drive back to Ohio a little happier though. If you don't like it *twitch*, more for me *twitch*.",5
"Amazing pizza, great service and a relaxed lunch = FIVE STARS!  If you're in Chicago this is the place to go.  I will warn you that a stuffed pizza takes 45 minutes to bake and a thin crust is 30 minutes so if you're about to pass out from hunger get the thin.",5
"This place is fantastic whether you're introducing visitors to a local Chicago restaurant, entertaining clients or want a beautiful evening for two.  The ambiance can be as romantic as you make it or as enjoyable as you would like and the wine list will impress your selective palette. I've tried the Gnocchi (carb loading evening), the Salmon (my steady eddy) with fresh vegetables and those with me rave on an on about their steak, talapia and pastas. All in all, there's nothing we have every ordered that's been a miss.  However, there's one thing everyone has to order whenever I go and it's the asparagus risotto (careful it's got white wine and can be addictive)! If you're looking for a great evening out and enjoy making the dining experience the center of your evening, this is a wonderful ",5
"You don't get to be around for as long as these guys have and not be a solid restaurant. Work in the city or looking for a great place to have a good dinner and get to the Bulls or Blackhawks game on time?  This is a place worthy of your strong consideration. Excellent bar/cocktails and an unbelievable staff that have worked there for many years.  I have had some of these people wait on me for over 15 years and I know a few have been there many more than that. My favorite dishes are their Pizza of course (rated as a best by Chicago Tribune---order ahead if you can), their ribs, fish and chips, entree salads, or burgers. Good.  Good. Good.",5
"The food here is awesome. The drinks are awesome. The staff is awesome. Lunch is not too pricey considering it is the Loop and the portions are HUGE. They give you the option to split with some one at the table too whereas some places down there scoff at the idea. After work drinks or dinner is fun and fantastic. I love the staff. If you love a good martini ask Lucy for her Dirty - you will not be disappointed!",5
"Consistently good Jewish Deli. The matzah ball soup is the best I've had. When we go I always order the Springer on Challah (they won't tell us who makes their fabulous Challah bread!) and it is always terrific.

"This was the first thing that I got at Chicago after landing here. My first flight was cancelled and I was famished. I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but my friend knew this place, though it be a slight food chain feel, was something special in Chicago (and apparently Florida). We got the pizza that could be shared 3-4 people, but obviously my friend and I finished the thing. We ordered the stuffed pizza with sausage and mushrooms. When this thing came out (about a 30-40 minute wait) I was amazed at the height of this thing. I had my first bite and I was in LOVE. ABSOLUTE LOVE with this dinner. It's just amazing and I realized why it takes soo long to make. 20 Minutes for the first layer of pizza and your picked toppings, and 20 minutes for the second layer (tomato sauce and c",5
"Until a few days ago, I had never been inside Garrett's.  It was one of those treats that I loved but always ate when someone brought it to work or a party.  However, I wanted to bring something to Thanksgiving and there wasn't a pie shop in site. When I went in to order, I knew that it would expensive but I had no idea of the price. I ordered a 2 gallon tin and realized that it was $55.  Wowser. After paying, I realized that I could get 2 gallons in bags for $26.  Since my family could care less about the tins, I was hoping that they would let me change my order.  Since there was hardly anyone in line, they did.  Thank you!",5
"I am obsessed with popcorn...more specifically Garrett's Cheesecorn. Oh lordy, this stuff is intense. One cannot possibly attempt to enjoy this while watching calories or on a diet. But, it is  the best way to treat yourself every once in a while. After you've tried Garrett's, O-Ke-Doke just won't cut it. This location is small but efficient. Workers are friendly and the line really moves. I would recommend eating this stuff with a spoon or some other utensil, as your fingers will be stained orange for a long time!!!",5
"Do yourself a favor. Do the supper veggie. The little broccoli is so cute!",5
"Garrett's is the best, and if the Mini Mix sounds gross, conquer your fears and try it anyway.  It's totally addictive. I will say to be very careful of this particular location, because it doesn't get the traffic of the North Michigan or Jackson Street locations.  Therefore, if you go there at off hours, the popcorn can get stale.  Earlier in the day is best.",5
"Great Burgers, good prices, and a fun crew. The only thing that they could improve on is the time it takes to make the food. Sometimes even during the slow hours it takes like 20 minutes to receive the food. Other than that, the place is fantastic. You gotta love their turkey burger on wheat!",5
"Giordano's is still my favorite deep dish pizza.  I've only been to this location once, and got take out since my hotel was just around the corner, so I can't comment on the wait staff.  I did have to wait in the takeout area for about 10 minutes.  Apparently my timing was good, since there were a group of guys in the bar that had more than 1 singing lesson, and broke out in song.  It even drew out some of the staff in the kitchen to listen. Getting back to the hotel, I got to enjoy what I consider to be the best deep dish pizza I've ever eatten.  Of couse like a dummy, I ordered a large for me and my wife, and we weren't able to eat the whole thing.  Good thing this pizza taste good the next morning cold for breakfast. If you get take out, don't forget to ask for plates and utensils.  You",4
"Jen took me here for my birthday. Everest sits atop the 40th floor of the Chicago Stock exchange at the corner of the South-west loop, and the Chicago sky-line views are beautiful. Not to be outmatched, the food was perfectly amazing. When the first course arrived I was worried that the small portions would be inadequate for a full meal. By course #12 though, I was perfectly stuffed. The waiter was attentive, and kind. Not too snobby or pushy. My only complaint is that he did not adequately explain the prix-fix menu. From ignorance we ordered a 'special' desert, which was $25 extra. But it turned out that the prix-fix dessert was tastier than the 'special' souffl.  That aside, given the opportunity I'd go back in a heart-beat. As as aside, join LEYE before you go, because you'll definitely",5
"This pizza place is certainly one of the greatest of Chicago. The place is well located, the menu and the variety of the pizzas are very good and the stuffed Pizza is amazing.Another good thing is that you can pick the toppings that you want and if you want to eat different pizzas every time you can !I went there with my family and after that with my girlfriend, and in both occasions we had delicious food with great treatment, so I recommend !",5
"Eleven City is one damned charming restaurant. Hold onto your pants as you enter lest they be charmed right off your body. The unusual mix of antiques, vintage-inspired design, and Judaica somehow pull together and work as a unique decor. I was in the neighborhood, walking from one industry event to another about four blocks away, when I realized I was starving. Eleven City was rated much higher than the other local eatery I could see from where I was standing, but...a diner? Hmmm.... I made the right decision! As soon as I came in, two different staff members said hi to me. When I was seated, I was offered reading material since I was dining alone. I hadn't heard of a phosphate, but when the barmaid explained them to me, I knew I wanted one. Delicious! I had the cherry flavor and have a f",5
"If you go here, you have to get the Chicago deep dish.  You aren't really experiencing Giordano's if you get a hand tossed pizza here.  Also, the spinach artichoke dip is incredible.  One small pizza deep dish was enough for me and my sister after the spin dip. You gotta know you will have to wait probably an hour or more if you go there for dinner.  If you are 21, you can knock a few back in the bar section while you wait for your table.  It's also really close to the Chicago Conrad hotel.  We just walked there and it took about 4 or 5 minutes.",5
"Old-fashioned soda fountain AND a full bar???!!!!! I absolutely love this place! The food is amazing. The service is fantastic - you feel like you're part of the family. One of the many times I've been here, one of the people in our group got a gold star for cleaning his plate from the owner's mother. How freakin' great is that?! It is expensive but worth every penny.",5
"I really love this place.  I've never actually been to the location as we always have it delivered to our office.   The sandwiches are consistent and delicious.  They're also really good about getting my super picky orders correct (I usually get the Corvallis on multi-grain bread - no tomatoes, and dressing on the side.). As far as I know their delivery range is pretty small, but they always accommodate a delivery to my office (at Jackson & Wacker) as long as there's a few sandwiches in the order. They are a little bit on a pricey side I suppose ($7 for the sandwich and a small side of chips, fruit, potato or pasta salad), but the sandwiches are excellent (MUCH better than a Subway or Potbelly's sandwich) so it's well worth it to stop by here every once in a while.",5

"Tip: PRE-ORDER the SUPREME DEEP DISH!! My family and i came here on a trip to visit my son, who had just graduated boot camp.  There was a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon around 3ish or so, we were told we could wait or pre-order our pizza so it would be ready shortly after we were seated.  Best advice we were given that day! We were seated and our pizza arrived within 10-15 minutes.  One slice of this pizza is all you need and i love my pizza (new york style preferred) but this was amazing! I was so full and happy we ended up taking the left overs back to the hotel for a midnight snack!  Street parking may be tough, you can always park at the sears tower parking lot and pay the parking fee, it is so worth it!",5

"On our visit to Chicago, my Dining Companion and I each chose a swanky restaurant for a night on the town.  He chose Everest and told me about the dress code.  I wear sneakers or flip flops almost every day, so I was a little concerned about the stuffiness of the restaurant.  A glance at the swanky French menu didn't put me at ease. With my high heels clacking and black dress swishing, we made our way up to the high-level restaurant.  Was this place white glove?  Absolutely.  Stuffy?  Not really.  Maybe a little.  It was quiet but not dead, just with that low social hum which is perfect for a romantic evening, especially if you can swing a table by a window with the incredible view. I was concerned ultimately about two things: that I would be shunned by snooty waiters for not being an old ",5

Straight out of Sears Tower we entered the first restaurant we saw - Giordano's. I had the sausage stuffed pizza and calamari. both were yummy. snacking on the calamari helped keep my stomach in check during the wait. thinking about it now I am appauled by how much I ate. i couldnt help it, that buttery, crispy crust just kept calling to me and I was too weak to resist. this is the yardstick that I will measure all future Chicago Pizza Adventures with.",5
"Last visit: April 2009. Friday dinner for two. This is my favorite location for my favorite restaurant! Great environment with multiple seating areas and location is fantastic (near Millennium Park). Food and service is always great! If you've never been, get the stuffed pizzas! I always get the large stuffed pepperoni and you'll do the same if it's your first time! However, keep in mind these things are thick and take time to cook (40 minutes to an hour depending on how busy). You can avoid the wait by preordering by calling in advance and letting them know when you will be stopping by to eat, which is what my friends and I always do. The only downside to this location is that it is always relatively busy when going for lunch or dinner on the weekend. Because of this, preordering in advan",5

"rip off.  $10.95 for a maybe 4 oz pastrami sandwich?   I dont think so.  If it was not a Sunday I would have headed over to Manny's on Clinton for a 12 oz pastrami for $11.95.  If you are going to be a NY style deli, then at least fill up the sandwich to 50% of what you would get in NY..... Matza Ball soup is lacking flavor.  Too bad,   They also need to work on the service.  Fries came out cold and could not find the waiter to get replacement until half my sandwich was gone.  The excuse that it was a very busy Sunday?  Duh! Then they should have staffed accordingly After being in business for a few years, they should have had it down by now.  They were a lot better in the beginning.",1

"Travesty of a place. We arrived early on a Friday, like senior citizen early. Two of the three of us were there, and said we were waiting on a third. The place was empty, so we assumed there would be no problem getting a table when our third arrived. And as they said nothing at all about it, we had no reason to believe that the hostesses thought otherwise. So, our third ran late. We were to meet at 4, and 20 minutes go by when we hear the hostess tell someone that there was a 45 minute wait. Thinking that couldn't be right, we walked up to ask, and we were told that yes, there was a 45 minute wait because a large party was coming in. When we asked if we'd only have 25 minutes because we arrived 20 minutes ago, they said that no, it was a 45 minute wait. When we asked why they didn't say th",1

"I had been to Emerald a couple of times and thought it was a typical, mediocre downtown bar that would be universally loved (as all Irish bars are). I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice! After another attempt to order a drink it w",1

For the main course I had the New York Strip in a red wine sauce. It came with diced potatoes mixed with onions and garlic on the side. My husband had the Prime Ribeye that came with mashed potatoes.

We arrived here on a Saturday night last summer to a completely empty restaurant.  That should have been the first clue.  Our sommelier (if he can even be called one) poured bits of cork into the first wine glass.  When we pointed this out, he kept pouring into the other glasses, then threw out the wine from the glass with the cork.  They never discounted the bottle or brough a new one.  In fact, they later overcharged us for it!  The other bottle of wine our group ordered was poured without even offering a taste (lest we find cork in that one too!). The menu left something to be desired.  I usually like to experiment, but the only appetizing thing I saw was the spaghetti.  It's hard to screw up spaghetti, right?  Well, they succeeded",1

So on a hot day downtown we decided to go in. Since I was trying to maintain my diet, I decided to get the Make it Light version, oh boy....for the next 5 hours I had the worst tummy ache ever. Not sure if it was this location, or the Make it Light that caused this, but I was not a happy camper. Also, this location was extremely slow - they had 3 workers (visible) and it took them 15 mins to take my order, and another 7 to make the 'tummy hurting make it light pomegranate pick me up' drink....",1

First, apparently the gentleman working messed up the order of the person in front of me (made the wrong sandwich) and didn't much make much of an offer to fix it. As he was cleaning the topping space from her two Mike's way sandwiches, he took the wayward leftover a pile of oil, vinegar and spices covered lettuce and threw it back in the lettuce bin. GROSS! I hope there's no one allergic the said toppings getting lettuce on their sandwiches. As he was making my boyfriend's #9, he starting making the wrong sandwich. Luckily I was paying attention.

We never had to complain about the owner (some other yelpers obviously have a different view) but the manager in place during the week  seriously suffers  from a napoleonic complex - arrogance inversely proportional to his size.

I've walked by this place numerous times-- put off as well as intrigued by the fact that the restaurant is a green shack about the size of a living room. But I decided to give it a shot today because I was craving some good Asian food. I wanted wonton soup, and I also wanted to be daring by trying their 'most requested item,' the hot dog fried rice. I was so excited that even the weird chemically cucumbery smell that hit me when I picked up the food didn't diminish my excitement. But it should've. My wonton soup was bland and the wontons were mushy. My fried rice contained what seemed like less than one sliced Oscar Meyer hot dog and the rest was just unflavorfully mushy rice.

They did not toast the bagel, but instead threw it on the grill with eggs being cooked for someone else.  Seemed gross.

We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again.

We figured it was ok, so waited the hour and the delivery guy was right on time.  Unfortunately, he brought a large thin crust pizza (we ordered stuffed).  I called in and the woman paused for a moment (probably realizing that it was almost time for them to go home) and then told me 'no, that's not what you order",1

The thin crust pizza that arrives is overcooked to the point of the pizza crust being brown (brown cheese really?) and no salt or flavor on anything.

Matza Ball soup is lacking flavor.  Too bad,   They also need to work on the service.  Fries came out cold and could not find the waiter to get replacement until half my sandwich was gone.  The excuse that it was a very busy Sunday?  Duh!

I will start by explaining my comment about the owner. Not  only does this guy walk around the restaurant talking way too loud and bossing his staff around unnecessarily, but he also is constantly coming up to tables and talking to them for too long while they are trying to eat (classic arti buco move).

"A very average breakfast experience here. The breakfast menu is pretty limited and the entrees were nothing to rave about about. I had the two eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs had too much pepper on them. Wouldn't you let the customer handle if they want salt/pepper on their eggs? The hash browns were greasy. It took quite a long time for us to get our entrees although the place was not crowded. With Wildberry so close, I can't imagine coming back here anytime soon. I hope the lunch menu is better than their breakfast!",2

"Most likely due to its prime downtown Chicago location, the prices are too high for what they are selling.  I ordered two Chicago style hot dogs, fries, and a Mountain Dew for $7 & change.  The dogs were of low quality - the meat had little taste, and the toppings left much to be desired.  They were skimpy on the tomatoes, the relish was an unnatural neon green color, and they put way too much celery salt on it.   Save your money and treat your stomach by skipping this place and going to Clark Street Dog instead.  Their hot dog toppings are deliciously fresh and they charge less for it.",2

"My BF and I went after many people recommended it. We went at 3:30pm on a Saturday. We were told the wait was 1.5 hrs and to order the pizza after 30 min. So that's what we did. We got seated about an hour in, but had to wait another 30 min for the pizza. We were starving and so excited since so many people had raved about how amazing this pizza was. And then, we were super disappointed. The pizza wasn't hot, it was warm, but not hot, and the sauce was eh. I already don't like waiting for food, but this was probably one of the biggest disappointments after waiting for so long.",1
"Can't really bring myself to come back here -- tomato sauce is an incredibly important part of a good pizza, and theirs is gross.  Given how fattening it is, it needs to really appeal to your most basal culinary desires, otherwise it fails.  This brand doesn't do it for me. I went once with my boss, to give us the opportunity to sit down and talk through some work issues.  Because I knew I wasn't that into the pizza, I decided on the spaghetti, which was overcooked and mushy.  And on top of it?  That sauce.",2
"Staying at the Fairmont nearby and wanting to try something distinctly Chicago, I ended up at Giordano's on my first night. I've never eaten 'authentic' Chicago deep dish or stuffed pizza and was pretty excited at the prospect. I've always enjoyed thicker crust pizza and from the praises and aesthetic of the Chicago pie, what's not to like. The execution of this beast of a pizza was quite bad by any means. There was just way too much going on, and none of it good. Too cheesy, up to a point where it was hard to eat. I imagine a depp dish crust to be crisp buy yet chewy with a nice give. But this crust had the texture of a cookie / biscotti. Too god damn hard. I'm sure this doesn't represent Chicago pizza as a whole and may as well be one of those places where tourist such as myself go to ex",2

While me and the girlfriend were out and about downtown we decided to swing by Garrett's. The place really was absolutbely nothing special. They place basically ran like a machine. You waited on line to give you order to the unfriendly cashier. They took your order basically without even saying a word to you. As you moved down the line you received your bag of popcorn from the big bin of popcorn that had probably been sitting there under the warmer since they opened that AM. I ordered the Caramel Crunch with Cashews and it was definitely good. They popcorn had a great flavor to it, and the cashew were a really nice added touch. The quality of the food was go",3

I then orderd the parma proscuitto thinking it would be delicious, thin, light and salty like they do it in Parma Italy.  Essentially what came out was thin-deli cut ham, did not even taste like proscuitto, very disappointed.  We both took one small bite and did not even finsih it.

"After having had an awesome experience ordering from Lou Malnati the night before, I decided to order similar dishes from Giordano's for a head-to-head comparison.  First up, it's the fried calamari.  While Lou Malnati's version was sublimely tender with a fresh tasting cocktail sauce; the Giordano's version was tough and soggy, and the cocktail sauce tasted every bit as being poured from a bottle. Giordano's is known for it's stuffed pizza, but the minimum size was 10' versus 6' at Lou Malnati's.  It was too much pizza for one person, and I was underwhelmed by the top and bottom crusts (which is what makes it 'stuffed').  If the crust is good, then one is more than enough.  And Lou Malnati's version also came out ahead in the pizza category for me.",2
"BF likes this place so decided to try it. It was extremely crowded so we finally got seated at the bar. Liked my food, a turkey burger, but nothing I haven't had before.  Was served a disgusting cup of coffee that tasted burnt. I don't usually send food back, but I figured they just needed to make a fresh batch. Owner/manager guy condescendingly asked what I normally drank, I said Dunkin, starbucks, the usual, and he explains that I don't like their coffee because I'm used to the cheap stuff.  Umm, okay whatever, your coffee is gross and your attitude is bad too. Also had to try to eat while the girl behind the bar moved around frantically, maybe she was new but it was distracting. Haven't been back since and let the bf know that if he was going he was on his own.",2

"Yet another Jerry Kleiner restaurant that fails to impress me; I find Gioco to be overpriced and the food simply average. There are no real standouts on the menu - you'll find the usual Italian offerings: carpaccio, calamari, pasta in a meat ragu sauce, and pizza. I did really like the ravioli di funghi, although Follia, which has since closed, made far better pasta (but suffered from a horrible location). I can actually deal with average Italian food, but what gets me about Gioco are the prices. Simply put, an $11 caprese salad better knock my socks off. We easily spent over $150 on dinner for two and it just wasn't worth it. The outside dining sounds nice, but it can actually pretty loud on Wabash, especially with the El thundering overhead.

The evening was further proof that good company and good conversation is what really matters, and can make a great time in the a less-than-great place. I don't consider myself a cheapskate in the slightest, but $16 for two drinks is a little steep if there's no liquor or food involved. The service was hit or miss.

I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out. The dressing is very very watered down. I have never had a caesar taste like that. There really was no flavor ",2

We started with the antipasto salad which was good, kinda a pain to eat with entire slices of cold cuts lying across the top of the salad, but once cut up was pretty good.  The little one wanted the mozzerella sticks, so we ordered those too - nothing special - just like ones you'd get at a bowling alley.

The calamari and antipasto appetizers were decent. Nothing phenomenal but they were served promptly, which helped tide us over while waiting the typical 45 minutes for the pizza to come out. We got their 'special' (sausage, mushrooms, onions, green peppers) but I felt like it was essentially a big, thick cheese pizza with a few good chunks of sausage.  But mostly you just get a big mouthful of cheese.  I agree with other reviews, that the crust is rather raw and doughy-tasting, which I really noticed and brought the pizza down a notch.

Why do my vegetables look like they were sitting in a pool of their own sweat for hours? And why do my fries look like they someone just insulted their mothers and they can't do a thing about it? Poor sad dejected things. Now the taste is ok. It's not terrible. But what leaves me angry is that it could be so much better. With just a bit more care taken to put the food together you can have a wonderful burger. Especially with the ingredients that they use. For a place with food that isn't really epic, the service can make up for it. ",2
"Most likely due to its prime downtown Chicago location, the prices are too high for what they are selling.  I ordered two Chicago style hot dogs, fries, and a Mountain Dew for $7 & change.  The dogs were of low quality - the meat had little taste, and the toppings left much to be desired.  They were skimpy on the tomatoes, the relish was an unnatural neon green color, and they put way too much celery salt on it.   Save your money and treat your stomach by skipping this place and going to Clark Street Dog instead.  Their hot dog toppings are deliciously fresh and they charge less for it.",2
"Pizza was mmmmeeeehhhhh.  Nothing special imo.  Service was 1 star.  Cheese was two stars.",2
"Solid 'meh'. For what it is, it's kind of pricey. The menu doesn't jump out as exciting, and the food was just okay. Nothing special. Fries had no seasoning. Pulled pork was what appeared to be leftover ribs (Cubed - which is not pulled, FYI) with barbecue sauce on top. I don't mean to be a southern or anything, but it just wasn't really good. But the place was packed. Lots of white people. Older white people. I was wondering if they were all tourists, because CLEARLY none of them lived in the loop or South Loop - super suburbanite looking bunch. There are just so many better places to eat for cheaper. Capping it off was some awful service. My friend asked if there were any drink specials. The waitress blankly looked and said 'no'. My friend asked 'do you have a martini you would recommend",2

"Usually buffets aren't my cup of sauce, but this was pretty alright.  There are two islands of food, one salads and another of entrees such as salmon, chicken, beef and vegetable melody, which consisted of broccolini and carrots.  I am always weary about food staying hot by over water, especially when that food starts with f and ends with ish.  The major reason for the low rating is for the service or shall I say, lack there of.  Running out of soda, okay no refills but water? And not as if su-waiters are standing around watching you eat.",2
"So if you added up all of the reviews on all of the locations of Jamba Juice around the city, you'd probably have a bazillion 5-star reviews.  I'm not faulting, the smoothies are great.  I'm a simpleton and the Strawberry Nirvana is perfection.  My curiousity about this secret menu is peaked but that will have to wait until next time... I'm reviewing the food today... I got a Groupon and was really excited to try a flatbread (who knew they had an oven?) and found out the Groupon didn't cover it.  So I had a choice of wrap, sandwich or salad plus a smoothie drink.  I went for the Asian Chicken wrap and wow ,was it bland.  Not bad, per say.  Just not really great.  Or even good.  I would probably make a face if I had to eat one again.  I was hoping for a new, healthy-ish food place for lunch",3

"I love me some Chicago.  I and was determined to fall in love with the Chicago food staple - the deepdish pizza - so trying Giordano's was a must. I really wish I could give this place more stars, but here are the reasons for docking of two stars: 1) Took forever.  We were seated promptly, but we didn't get our drinks for the longest time.  Deepdish pizza naturally takes a long time to make, but the wait was almost unbearable considering we were starving.  Good thing we ordered some fries to tie us down during the 45 minute wait. 2) We settled for this place instead of Gino's East.  We were a bit a way from that place and was too lazy and too hungry to go there.  Perhaps we should have.  The thought 'maybe Gino's is better' lingering in the back of your mind keeps your from fully enjoying ",3

"Love this place.  First time I had ever heard of Smithwicks, so naturally I tried it with my shepherds pie.  Just excellent.  Portions were large, atmosphere was sort of like being in Alan Quartermain's sports club, old style with heavy dark wood, and brass highlights.  Good choice for taking visitors and friends for a drink.",3
"I've been here a couple of times because it's really close to work.   I like the fact that this place has many options to build your own burger, and uses natural ingredients.  You can pick what type of bun you like, (either white or whole grain) and pick the meat you like, whether it be beef, turkey or veggie.  You can also choose from a few different cheeses and grilled vs. raw onions.  (I love that they offer the option to choose Havarti!!) They've also got bacon and a fried egg as options, if you feel as though your heart is strong enough to handle the  extra ingredients. The burger itself is good- hand smashed on the grill so it's thin-ish (approx half an inch thick, maybe less) and it's really juicy (greasy).  However, I tend to prefer my burgers on the thick side, medium to medium ra",3
"Meh. This place seems to get mixed reviews...so here's mine! We ordered a deep dish and I was expecting much better for all the hype this place has! Nothing really stood out about this pizza: sauce was ok, cheese was ok, toppings (well, fillings) were ok too. It was just ok. It got the job done, we walked out full but I definitely didn't have the 'WOOO, I just had the bestest Chicago-style deep dish pizza evAr' feeling that I was hoping to get. Not going to be telling my friends to check this place out, but hey, I guess I've tried real deep dish now.",3
"Wanted to update my review after a recent trip back. Usually on a Sunday night this place isn't too busy but for some reason they had something going on. I found everyone their struggling to sit everyone and rushing around frantically. I had the guy who was hosting move our table before I even got up to get us out of the way and then had a waitress walk into my chair twice telling me to 'be careful'.....really? that's not cool man. Now don't get me wrong, I do like Eleven City but was super bummed out by their lack of service. I opted to try their  lunch/dinner options and stayed safe with a Turkey Club with a Chocolate Malt --the sandwhich was OK but huuuge but Malt was awesome. If I go back I'll probably opt for lox, knish or breakfast menu items. Show owner comment »",3
"Everest is a phenomonal restaurant.  The views are amazing and the food is excellent.  I also LOVE the decor and ambiance. HOWEVER, our waiter was a complete snob and very rude- hence, the 3 star review.  He wouldn't even offer a suggestion on the menu when I asked what his personal favorite entree was!  It is one thing to attend to your guests and provide excellent service, but that doesn't mean you can't lighten up, gauge the personality of your table and act accordingly. I would go back again, I have only been there once.  But I'm not raving because our waiter was a total jacka*s.",3
"Deep dish pizza was a must try on list of things to eat at Chicago. My friends and I came here during weekday lunch hour, around 11ish and the restaurant was pretty empty. I think we ordered the small special. The pizza was only luke warm and the mozzarella cheese had already started to turn hard. I like my pizza on the warmer side with the cheese still being gooey. The crust was good though and not thick and doughy.",2
"Located in the lobby of the 101 N. Wacker building, this is a great place to dine for lunch, or for dinner before you night at the opera.   They offer a happy hour free buffet on Mondays (I think). I was there on a Monday and it was free. The selection was vegetables, dip and a chicken fajita pizza.  Interesting combinations. The lunch menu is decent and their soups are a perfect comfort food.   The portions can be a bit much, but it's still a good deal for a loop restaurant.",3

"Eh.  It wasn't awful, but the way they hype up their burgers, they're very forgettable.  Waitress screwed up my drink order about three times, and it was just beers.  It wasn't too far off, as she'd get the family of brands right, such as Sam Adams, but if I asked for a Noble Pils, a Boston Lager would return.  It really didn't bother me too much and became a kind of fun game of what she would return with.  If I lived nearby, I could see myself going here as my local, but since I'm a few miles away, I likely won't return.",3

"Just okay.  There were too many options on the menu.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this.  But at Goodwin's all the menu options look the same!  For instance: Corvalis: turkey, lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, cheddar, monterey jack and thousand island on white ($6.50) Montecito: turkey, lettuce, avocado, tomato, cheddar, monterey jack on multigrain, and open face ($6.75) so basically a quarter and a few calories difference.  less IS more. the only thing saving this place from a lower score is the guac and salsa--AMAZING.  I eat a lot of guacamole (it has justifiable health benefits) and Goodwin's has almost the best I've ever had in Chicago.  unfortunately, the chips are Tostitos or something similar--could not hold their own against the dips--and the chip to dip ratio was out of pro",3
"Really deserves a 3.5 but that's because I really just dig their name!! I liked it even though it's a chain (20 locations across Canada and the U.S.). Look past the trendy locals and confused/amazed tourists and you have a nice bar. A little packed for me at especially at 5:30 but we really only waited for 10 minutes. The host was extremely nice too bad our waitress wasn't as cheerful. She was busy I get it and her other tables were a lot larger of a group but she still could have been a little nicer. Like the other reviewers say 'Not the most authentic', but they did have some of the British classics on the menu. Not to mention the decor of the place. The veggie platter, pretzels, and chicken skewers with peanut sauce were good; but note to self do not order the veggieburger ever again, i",3
"We really enjoyed the deep dish pizza.  The services was - eh.  We went on Sunday evening and a few of the waitresses and a bus boy were dressed up for halloween.  We are not fans of halloween, but to each his own.  I felt kind of bad for one of the waitresses because she was dressed up as Madonna or a bride or a mix of both and the table she was helping laughed at her constantly.  Jerks.  I mean - like I said - we don't do halloween, but we didn't make fun of anyone either. Our waitress (was not dressed up) had a habit of disappearing, not refilling our drinks and putting forth as minimal of an effort as possible.  Typically, we order from Giordano's in Hyde Park and always delivery.  So this could have been an off night for this location.  I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and a sho",3
"A noisy little lunch spot right under the El, and they'll serve you up some delicious grease. I had a Chicken Ranchero sandwich with bacon. It was huge, served open face, and totally delicious. I had to really work at holding it together, but other than that I was happy. My lunch companions seemed happy with their food as well. No one was raving, but it was good. Not on top of the try again list, but perfectly acceptable.",3
"We just moved to the south loop - and luckily I had a Groupon for this place in my Groupon arsenal. I was put off immediately when they seated us on the lower platform - directly underneath someone else who was eating. At 5:30pm on a Tuesday they couldn't find any other table in the whole place (which was almost completely empty) to seat us. This irritated me to no end since I got to hear Mr. Neighbor slurp his pasta. And our waiter - yuck! Didn't explain the antipasti selections even though we asked. I was somewhat sad that they offered no green salad but we went on to order anyway. After we ordered, we overheard another waiter voluntarily tell his guests that a Cesar salad is always available even though it's not on the menu. I ordered the Cappesante (scallops with spinach/mushrooms) and",3
"Besides being in a dungeon, I really can't complain about this place.  The falafel sandwich is good, not great.  The chicken sandwich was also good.  The service is sweet, although confused on how to use a KGBdeal.  I wouldn't really come here that often because I like windows, but it's not bad if you want decent, cheap food.  I wanted some baklava but you know, the calories from the falafel fit my quota for the meal.  Anyway, I am sure it was delicious.",3
"A-OK. I'll be back I'm sure. Just not ga-ga over it. Go to Eleven City Diner for the commercialized New York-Jewish Deli menu. Don't be mistaken, this is definitely not a bad thing.  The place overtly tries hard to imprint this impression on it's guests, and it works.  Especially when all the wait-staff are yelling, 'HOT SOUP!' when absolutely no one is carrying around soup. Whatev's. This place is great for brunch, especially if you are with a group of people with some craving breakfast while others want burgers & sandwiches.  They serve breakfast all day--- and they want you know know that.  Supposedly they have french toast 'to die for,' but I'll have to update my review if I ever get over my savory kick.

Hot & sour soup - pretty standard - I think theirs is vegetarian though so lacking some of the flavor and ingredients (no woodear, meat, etc.) Potstickers - a bit greasier than usual and less crunchy than I like (one side crisp / one side soft) - the sauce could use a bit more ginger.",3
"There is a history here.  A history of restaurants that have catered to the business and tourist crowd alike over the many decades that a restaurant has occupied this space on Wabash.   Exchequer, however, kind of left me feeling flat the other night, but maybe they were just having an off night.  My regular haunt in this 'neck of the woods' is Millers Pub located one block north so when I wandered in here, it had a pretty high benchmark to hit as I like Millers. There were a couple of hiccups along the way.  First, when we we were seated, no one came to take our order.  I finally flagged down a person who ask who was our server and she said it was her.  So we placed our order for a pizza and a couple of drinks. She said it would take 30 minutes for a pizza trying to suggestive sell us an ",3
"We were in Chicago for a wedding and opted to do Chicago-y things while we were there, hitting up Michigan Ave and Navy Pier.  We stopped in Giordano's for lunch because it's a classic Chicago meal.  It was just ok.  We waited for about 15 minutes for a table which wasn't bad, and we had to wait about 35 minutes for the pizza, but understandably that's because they have to bake it. The toppings were skimped on, but it was good.  It just wasn't great and something I have to rave about.  I mean, I like cheese and all.  Being from Milwaukee, we get a bad rap about putting cheese on everything.  For the record, we did NOT come up with pizza stuffed with an extra two pounds of cheese. After about 30 minutes to an hour, the extra couple pounds of cheese you consumed will catch up with you in som",3
"I finally got to taste Giordano's pizza.  After having tried Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Pizzeria Uno for deep dish and being disappointed, I almost gave up.  But several people told me that they liked Giordano's, so I decided to give it a try.  My best friend from high school was in town, so I had the perfect reason to go. We ordered a small, half spinach, half beef pizza.  The toppings (or fillings, rather) didn't have much flavor, but the cheese was pretty good.  I also liked the crust, which was salty, chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, without being greasy.  The small is more than enough food for three people. While I still like Zachary's in Berkeley better, if I'm going to eat deep dish, I think Giordano's should be your tourist destination if you're going to try deep",3

Their slices of cake are HUGE btw and if you actually think you will have room for dessert after you eat pizza here, then well....you must have really clogged arteries. Because their deep dish here is seriously deep dish. My brother who eats a ton had trouble eating two slices here, and I had to cut my second piece in half!

For all the hype this place gets, the pizza did not meet expectations. The tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza was overwhelming and didn't taste fresh. I had to drink a lot of water after my first slice because the bread was so thick and dry. When you bite into it feels like you are just biting through layers. The tomato sauce, cheese, and bread doesn't feel integrated. Their thin crust however was solid. But its hard to mess up a thin crust pie. The wait staff are very nice.

Bottom line is that I'd rather eat here than in my own local pub back in England. For booze, its a tough call. I guess the prices are pretty decent and the staff are friendly.

Total came out to ~$12. The burger was not over-cooked and the meat was flavorful and held together well (very important for a good burger). I read that you could add a fried egg on top of the burger, and I certainly look forward to going back to try that. The chocolate shake was just to die for...perfect for a TGIF lunch.

Coming from someone who can never go vegan due to her propensity towards cheese consumption, I found the lukewarm, half-inch-thick layer of cheese on my pizza inedible. I pulled about half off before eating my slice, in a classic 'I'm doing what's best for the both of us' break-up. In the end, I suppose I'm the one ",3
"Staying at the adjacent Club Quarters, we had to try E&C. Pros: Many beer options in bottle and draft.   Friendly bartenders.   Banana french toast Cons: Slow service (there were 2 waitresses doing nothing as another did all the work) TV screens are too small to watch the World Cup",3
"Started with the chop salad, which was fine. Then had the sausage, pepper, mushroom deep dish pizza. It was just so-so. I expected it to be more flavorful (it's VERY rare for me to say a restaurant serves food that isn't flavorful enough, usually it's the opposite problem). With so many other deep dish pizza options in Chicago, I'd definitely try another place first before coming here.",3
"Great place to grab a quick sandwich during lunch. Don't be scared away by the long line- they've got a system down at Goodwin's so you'll have your food within 5 minutes.  I've tried most of the sandwiches on the menu and everything is good.",3
"Came here for a light dinner and drinks with a vegetarian coworker.  Bad choice for a vegetarian. We ordered a share plate of sweet potato fries, pub pretzels, and veggie spring rolls.  (Don't even get me started on why Irish & British pubs serve Asian food...).  All the apps were pretty meh, but I stuck with vegetarian items to be nice, so maybe that's not a fair assessment. The Big Ben Brownie made up for it, simply delicious. Stella drafts were on special for $5, which was nice. Nice decor and great staff; our server Raheel was always there to ask if we needed anything.  We definitely overwelcomed our stay, but he was nice to check in on us once in a while after dessert. Convenient location; I'll have to give it another try with some carnivores.",3
"Bleckh! Not like this is the restaurants fault but the patio has go to go! Sitting there listening to the screetching and squealing of the train going by 10 feet above my head every 3 minutes was like listening to fingers on a chalk board. Well, why didnt we just sit inside, you ask? There was a wait and we were in a hurry. To add to my experience that wasnt off to a good start, I ordered Guinness Stew and was accidentally served a big pile of poo. They tried to disguise the look by sprinkling some chopped tomatoes and green onion on it. The first and only other time I had Guinness stew was in the originating country of the dish; Ireland. And it was good! tender juicy, melt in your mouth pieces of beef mingling in a hearty sauce with tender root veggies all served in a crock. What I got at",3
"Get ready to eat the thickest pizza ever. A slice of deep dish pizza will stuff you for the rest of the day.",3
"We had really high expectations. - Appetizer: Combination Platter - mozzarella strips, breaded zucchini strips, & breaded mushrooms - nothing special... - Stuffed Pizza - Pepperoni & Mushrooms - again, nothing special.. we expected to be blown away. Our Chicago friends prefer Gino's or Lou Malnati's over Giordano's. Our cab driver preferred Domino's over everything haha. Wish we took their advice and tried a different pizza place while we were visiting. Service was great though!",3
"This is a traditional looking British pub with a good beer selection. I was excited to see that they had Guinness 250 on draft when it first came out during the controversy (it was bad, but it was fun to give it a try). There aren't a ton a bars in this area, so it's nice to have this place as an option after seeing a play in the theatre district. Downsides? The music has been terrible when I've been here. I don't mind techno, but seriously, it's just not appropriate for a British pub like this. Secondly, although the actual bar is nice, the rest of the place has the feel of a Bennegins or similar chain restaurant. Maybe it's the carpeting or something.",3
"We live a few blocks from Gioco--easy walking distance-- so end up eating here more often than we would if we lived driving distance.  In fact, I'm not sure how often we'd eat here if it were less convenient.   The decor is typical  trendy--exposed brick walls, high ceilings with all the mechanicals exposed, very loud background noise.  You also run the risk of being seating along the railing, which means that another party is either directly above or below you.  I've wondered why they don't stagger those tables, like theater seats.  Probably they can cram more in this way.  You can also get stuck next to the open kitchen, which is either interesting or annoying depending on your take. Service:  Spotty.  We've had attentive, friendly waitstaff like the girl we had last night.  We've also h",3
"I was in Chicago for a conference and during a lunch break several of us went and hit up Giordano's because it was close and because it seems to have a bit of a reputation around Chicago. I was excited to have my first taste of real Chicago deep dish and expected it to easily top the imitation deep dish I had had at Sacramento's 'Chicago Fire' just a few weeks earlier. I was a bit disappointed.  The pizza was good, don't get me wrong.  I just didn't think it was that great.  In fact I liked Sacramento's imitation a bit better.  Believe it or not the ingredients at Chicago Fire seemed to be of a higher quality and there seemed to be more care put into the pizza.  Plus it was cheaper. We had the super veggie and the meat.  Both were good, but they didn't blow me away.  Giordano's was easily ",3
"The Emerald Loop is in my office building, so I've spent quite a bit of time here having lunch or grabbing drinks with colleagues after work.  This is a great spot for both.   Some of my favorite dishes include the fish and chips, grilled cheese sandwich, smoked salmon salad, and the chicken sandwich.  A little higher quality than your typical bar food.   They have a great outdoor patio with views of Trump Tower and the Tribune building -- a great happy hour spot if the weather is nice and you work in the Loop.   I hear they have a big St. Patrick's Day celebration - can't wait!",3
"Great supposed fast food burgers that are pricey. We had the combo with milk shakes, and it was almost $25 for the both of us. The burgers were juicy and beef and they served everything on biodegradable materials, and applaud them for that.",3
"Don't judge me for the fact that my reviews of late have been about pizza joints. I eat other things, I swear. So my verdict for Giordano's is---not as good as Lou Malnati's! (But better than Gino's East). I appreciated the pre-order option here (we ordered while waiting, so by the time we were seated we only waited 10 mins before our pizza arrived). But the pizza itself was overwhelming, our mushrooms and olives were smothered by the cheese, and in general it felt like way too much. I realize that deep dish isn't meant to be a 'light meal,' but I feel like Lou Malnati's finds the perfect ratio of ingredients to cheese to crust for a deep dish pizza.",3
"This place gets fairly busy for lunch, but they usually have open tables. One beef that I have with the place is that they don't take reservations or seat you until your party is there in full. We had a lunch meeting and were waiting for the whole party, but wanted to order some appetizers, but they wouldn't seat us. Once our full party arrived we were finally seated, but chose not to get appetizers (lost revenue for Elephant!). The food was surprisingly good and the service was adequate. I wouldn't say we got the best service in the world as our drinks were empty during half of our meal, but then again the server took the drinks off our bill! It's worth a try if you're in the area and looking for a pub with good food.",3
"I go this particular Giordano's a lot with coworkers. It's a good lunch spot that doesn't get a lot of objection from anyone in the group. I'm a big fan of the cheese garlic bread. The most economical thing to do is to split a pizza with a few people, but sometimes we each do our own thing and order entrees. I would not recommend the baked mostaccioli - it is really disappointing. I prefer thin crust over the stuffed pizza since it's less of a brick in your stomach. But really, it doesn't matter what you eat here, you'll be in a food coma afterwards. Don't forget to take a mint or two on your way out. I think the service here is really hit or miss. Sometimes we have a great server, other times we are desperately trying to flag someone down to help us.",3
"My fiance and I came upon this place after a long and weary trek to the top of the Sears (er, I guess I mean Willis) Tower. I very much appreciated they were there and open, since the next best options seemed to be McDonald's. I also appreciated that they make it clear it's going to take a long time to get your pizza, so we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and devoured it while waiting for the pizza. The dip was good, though I'm not sure it was stellar - although I was hungry so it was fantastic! Hmm, the pizza. We ordered the stuffed pizza with fresh tomatoes and pepperoni, but really they sell a cheesy-stuffed cheese pizza - there were about 4 slices of tomato on top of the pizza and I found 2 pieces of pepperoni in my slice, so you might as well just order the cheese pizza. It's stuffe",3

"Solid pub in the loop. Stopped in and had a decent bite to eat with friends and a drink. Above par pub food but nothing exceptional on our plates. Worth it if you're looking for a decent meal in that area. 100 times better than J. Randolph on Michigan Ave. Oh, we did not have the ribs or pizza (their specialties) so perhaps if those were that good I'd bump it up a star.",4

"It's hard for me to make up my mind about Gioco.  I really want to love it, but I can only like it.  And it seems I like it a little less with each visit.  I've been here four times over several years, and it just seems that it isn't as good as it used to be.   Why do I want to love Gioco?  Because it's semi-local and because it just has a sort of cool vibe.  I like the bricks.  I like the bar.  And I like the open kitchen, as long as the place is somewhat busy.  If it's not busy, it will seem like the kitchen staff is laser beaming you. The problem with Gioco for me is that there's not much on the menu I can eat due to my ever present picky palate.  I've gone with the steak on most occasions.  Once I had the pasta with ragu meat sauce.   The steak is good, but I think it was best the firs",3
"Way overpriced for the quality of food.  Let's go item by item... Drink specials- not special, still expensive. Burgers - $10, they are decent, but not worth $10.  They are $7 on Monday, so worth it on Monday only.   Mac n' cheese - $12, I assume because it had truffles in it.  But it was disgustingly filled with white truffle and tasteless cheese.  So the mac n' cheese just tasted like noodles with white truffle....kinda nasty and I like truffles. Potato skins, pretty good, but overpriced like everything else on their menu. Service, not so great either.  We had Robert who seemed pissed off at us from the start.  Not sure why, maybe cuz one of our friends asked if he could just start with a water, but that was before he ordered an app and the $12 mac n cheese!  He also was slow as hell, he",3
"Why can't this place take the place of the Golden Nugget a block from my house? Seriously! This place is awesome. When you walk in it looks like a legit diner. I've heard tons of good things about this place and finally made the trek down to Columbia territory and manged to avoid getting caught in hipster traffic. I really wanted breakfast but just had to get a sandwhich so I could compare it to my last pastrami from Katz's deli. We opted for the Woody Allen, which is half pastrami and half corned beef. Ok so they claim to have 'the best pastrami west of lower east side' and I'll give them that, but it's definitely different than Katz's but still very good and definite the best that I've had outside of NYC. Their mac n' cheese with bacon was artery-clogging good.It was super cheesy and had",4
"My family 'popped' into town from Texas.  Since they were coming in from the Millennium Park train station, I found this tiny Giordano's on Yelp!  Who knew that this tiny location even existed?   The hostess was super accommodating to our group that grew in size and was then 20 minutes late.  Our pizzas took awhile but that is deep dish for ya.  I wish that they would have come around to ask us about dessert a bit earlier: I always make my nieces and nephew get some delish cheesecake while they are in town.  When they brought it out, I had to ask for the check immediately so that they wouldn't miss their train. I would definitely come back!",4

If you want a good burger that's the one to order,real good think sliced bacon plus cheese. We got the cheese fries too and they were great. This a little diner and we enjoyed it a lot.You can also eat your lunch and do some people watching off the streets.It was priced a little higher than other burger joints but it is something worthwhile to visit.",4
"OMG I love deep dish pizza! When I visited Chicago, it was recommended to us that we try the pizza here. My husband and I ordered a medium 'Special' deep dish pizza which had sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions.  After a LONG 45 minute wait (we were starving and it was 9:30pm), our pizza arrived. It was the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. It was a slice of hot cheesy, greasy goodness!  Definitely a must try if you're in Chicago.",4
"Admittedly, I have yet to be to China town...but this is the only good Chinese food I've had in Chicago so far. Very similar to NYC Chinese takeout. The food is good, plentiful, and inexpensive. Lunch dishes come with rice for around $6 and it's more than enough for 2 people. You should definitely go to their place too because it's a trip. You basically stand in tight quarters, yell out your order, and then they get it to you in a few minutes. Very informal. Soup Nazi-ish but not mean. Chinese Food For You! 2 Years!",4

"I hear the view is spectacular from Everest's 40th floor location in the Chicago Stock Exchange building.  Unfortunately, we happened to dine there on one of the many cold, cloudy nights we had in Chicago this winter.  The dining experience was so lovely, however, that I didn't even miss the view. I'm not exactly sure how long the restaurant has been there, 25 years maybe, but it carries the vibe of a very classic American-style fine dining place.  It's not over-the-top gaudy or showy, not boisterous or pretentious, just simple, beautiful and elegant.  The food is not deconstructed or petit or very fancily plated.  It simply is what I imagine fine dining used to be. It is one of those places, however, that sneak in extra courses when you aren't looking.  I have to say, I kind of love that ",5
"What a great lunch place.  Prices are a bit high but at least the food was good.  Brisket sandwich was yummy but the coleslaw was a bit soggy.  Vanilla fountain coke was good.  Burger with crunchy onions was delish. However, we were not crazy about the red velvet cake; it was a bit dry and lacked flavor. It was a fun place to go for a change of pace and scenery in the south loop area.  Will go back to sample more food and for drinks!",4
"It had been a very long day and our first night in Chicago. It's past 10PM and finding places on my list this late was no longer a priority for us. Just finished listening to the great Ramsey Lewis celebrate his 75TH birthday at the Millennium Park's Jay Pritzker Pavilion. Plus we were under dressed for the windy cold evening. On the way back to the Hotel Burnham we walk pass Johnny Rockets filled with customers. It looked clean and safe. Hey, at this time of night one has to make priorities. Either get something quick to eat or don't eat at all. Didn't realize that Johnny Rockets carried an Italian beef sandwich. So, we ordered the sandwich, American fries and their Smoke House Single to go. Got our order pretty quickly and dashed to our hotel room just a couple of blocks away. Turned on ",4
"Just wanted to update and say that they no longer offer the porterhouse. Came here the other night and as always, service was impeccable and we got a lot of personal attention: water glasses always filled, plates taken away, bread refilled, etc. Food was delicious. I had the linguine with white clam sauce. The clams were fresh and sweet and the pasta was al dente. Perfect. The dish came wrapped in paper and foil, which was different and I'm thinking the clams were steamed in this package right before arriving to the table. However it was kinda weird eating out of the foil and paper. Did our server forget to remove it for me? Was I supposed to pour the contents onto my plate myself? *shrugs* Still very tasty and I think this will be my regular dish here. And the rapini was still as good as ",4
"Met up for lunch here with a buddy while on a business trip.  If you want their deep dish (which is what I've been told their famous for, you'll need to plan some time.  The deep dish takes 40 minutes to cook, but definitely worth the wait.  Be sure to order right when you get it.Haven't been eating a ton of pizza lately, but this was totally worth the splurge.",4
"I was so excited to eat here! I mean, it was amazing! Loved all the cheese and it was seriously so much food! So come with an empty stomach because I could barely finish 1 slice! It's a very popular place, but I was surprised that the wait was not too long, and it was definitely enjoyable.",4
"I'd give this place 5 stars but some of their tables are insanely close together and makes things a little uncomfortable sometimes, so 4 stars it is. But Gioco is a great place. If you've walked by Gioco at night, then you know when you look inside that everyone's having a great time. I get a little jealous myself walking by when I have no one to go there with. I feel your pain. But once you're inside, it's awesome. Everybody loves Italian food and you won't find any surprises on the menu, but everything is prepared very well. I've always been a sucker for caprese salads, but the arugula and pear salad is where it's at. On the pasta side, you can never go wrong with the gnocchi.

"I hate you Giordano's. As I'm sitting here two time zones west of you, all I can do is dream about having another meal at your place. **Raises fist in the air** We originally were planning to grab take out since you need about 30 minutes of wait time when you order a stuff crust pizza. The weather was nice, so maybe some pizza in Millennium Park was the idea. We phoned it in and took our time walking over. However, when we walked into the place and saw that it wasn't over flowing with people, we quickly asked if it would be okay we dined in instead. Simple décor, what a pizzeria should look like: checkered table cloths, long dining rooms, a full bar in the corner. All it was missing was an mini arcade for the kids! Dining in was actually their benefit because we ended ordering the chicken ",4

"This was always a nice place to go before a three hour class or for parties. They have a decent selection of things to drink (though I've heard their Guinness is nothing to write home about). The pizza wasn't bad. I've been spoiled by Transfer in Milwaukee, but I really liked the hummus. It was some good stuff, although they give you a lot. The problem is, there's not always room at the bar, so if you just want drinks, you're not welcome to sit beyond the bar. To do so would attract the evil eye from whoever's waiting on you. You've been warned.",4
"This particular JJ's really does operate by their motto (subs so fast you'll freak).  It was a regular lunchtime spot for my co-workers and me, and once you have 'regular' status they'll know you by name and have your sandwich waiting basically the second you walk in the door.   Service here is really good especially for a fast food place.  They're all so friendly and have great attitudes, especially the Steve lookalike (of SATC).",4
"Yum! Such a mouthful of deep dish pizza can only spell out one thing in the end: F-O-O-D C-O-M-A. Literally, I think I napped after just one slice of these bad boys.

We went to one place that our hotel recommended however, we ended up leaving after being there for 10mins. We went to Giordano's hoping their service was going to be better and that the pizza was going to be good. IT WAS!!! Our server was super sweet and everything was so good! We got Fried Zucchini as an appetizer- so good! and we had gotten 1/2 cheese, 1/2 Pepperoni Stuffed Pizza. It was all so wonderful. There were alot of people in the restaurant and there were alot of families and children. Everyone was happy. and we were full by the time we left! We had gotten a medium sized pizza- for the two of us...we each were stuffed on the app and 2 slices each and we now have a l",4
"Wow. That is all I can say. My friends from out-of-town and I spent an evening dining at Gioco and we were all blown away. We started out with fried calamari and prosciutto appetizers and they were amazing. The sauces with the fried calamari were sensational. Around the horn, my date had pasta (I don't recall which one, but I know it was the one that was made with speck) and it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I had the pork tenderloin scallopini and it was also great-- fantastic potato salad-esque side dish. The dish of the night was ordered by my friend's fiancee-- she had the veal entree and after trying one bite I was kicking myself for not ordering that as well. Damn it. Finally, my friend had the dual beef filets, which were also delicious, though he was not as big a",4

It was the strangest thing, I felt a little sick immediately afterward (from consuming dough and cheese very quickly topped by two beers), but after that, it was like I had just gotten all of my eating done, and could focus on other things.  I didn't feel bloated or gross, just un-hungry.  It was a little amazing.  If I lived in Chicago, I could just eat here once a day and be set--it would be totally efficient. Our server was in training, so she was a little ",4

However, they use lost of organic foods (even organic Heinz ketchup, which I didn't even know existed), the fried are light and not grease-soaked, and the burgers are made from fresh, hand packed patties rather than frozen machine-stamped ones. I had an epic burger value meal with everything, plus cheddar cheese. Very yummy and satisfying. They give you TONS of fries with your order.",5

"Food: Very good deep dish pizza. As others have said, it will take 30-45 mins before your food comes out. It is a very cheesy pizza and I would even suggest telling the waiter to go light on the cheese. It really makes no sense that there is so much cheese on a pizza. Kind of a turn off honestly. The crust is nice and doughy yet flakey. Very filling pizza. Even 'real men' would eat it with a fork/knife. If you are in a party of two please get the size lower than medium. I would assume that is a small. There is no way in the world that two people (man + woman) can finish a medium pizza. Too much food. All of that cheese doesn't help either. If you can, call in advance to place your order so you won't be sitting at your table for ever. Workers: No complaints. Atmosphere: Default. Overall: If",4
"Never having had Chicago style deep dish pizza before, I was very intrigued and surprised trying it for the first time. I always thought deep dish pizza just meant thicker crust and more dough. But it turns out Chicago deep dish pizza isn't 'deep' in a sense that the dough is thicker, but more so it's deep like a pie. In fact, the crust is actually quite thin! It's the many layers of toppings and cheese that makes it thick. My friends and I ordered the 'Large Special Deep Dish Pizza ($26.75) - Sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions'. It took 40 mins to prepare and cook, and we were tempted to order other things on the menu like salad and pasta while we waited. But we persevered, and when it finally came, it was worth it! The large pizza is cut into 8 slices that are seemingly manageable",4

"I had a great lunch meal here.  I had the Schwartzy on the waitress's recommendation and was not dissapointed.  My wife and I also split a plate of cheese covered fries. I topped it off with a Brooklyn egg cream which was also great. While the sandwiches were great, I didn't think there was anything awsome about the fries (they were very good).  My wife and I also tried the desert a few nights later and didn't find anything about the chocolate or carrot cakes to write home about. At some point I'd like to come back and try their breakfast foods. The lines seem long for most of the day.  We got there at 2pm on a Saturday and had to wait 30 minutes.  On the other hand, we came back a few days later at 8pm for desert and were seated immediately.

I had the papardelle pasta with roasted boar (thanks Kristin!) which was superb! The meat was soft and fresh. The tiramisu was just average though- its the heavy kind, not the soft fluffy kind. Overall, this place is one to return to. What's stopping me for giving it 5 stars? The not-so-friendly hostess who DID NOT GREET ME at the door.

"Hello Chicago! & being in Chicago, I had to try a Chicago-style deep-dish pie at the source. After a long day of wandering the city on foot, it was dark out & I was pooped. Would it be possible to get my iconic pie delivered? Yup. Giordano's has a location near where I was staying in the Loop & they deliver. I ordered a Chopped Salad & large Special Stuffed Pizza for delivery online. Because of the weight & thickness of this monster pie, cooking it would take a while. Wait time expectations would need to be adjusted accordingly. Even so, my order didn't take too long to arrive at my hotel. So, how was my Chicago-style pie from 1 of the most reputable & well known deep-dish purveyors in Chicago? Pretty good. Not magical, not mind-blowing, but pretty good. The Chopped Salad was about the sam",4
"Okay, Exchequer is sort of a divey feeling restaurant/bar with good food and good pitchers of beer. Well maybe not divey but some of the waitstaff look like they're about 2 months removed from paying their debt to society (okay it's just one guy really and since he's been there at least a couple of years from my experience my 2 month estimate can't be right). Maybe not divey but not fancy. However the Monsterburger is good though don't get the bleu cheese burger as it's the one sandwich they stumble on (blue cheese dressing instead of actual bleu cheese). Despite some of the above statements it's a real good place for an after work dinner or drinks with friends. BTW, they do have a variety of salads for when you don't want to eat a burger the size of Soldier Field.",4
"I'm not over it....been back 5 times and keep 'refining' the order...Here's what I have so far.  Single epic on toasted egg roll, raw onion, let, tom, ket, must, no special sauce.  With all the choices they offer, I find the simple burger is the way to go!  I saw some dude get an egg on top of his double...nicely played my man!",4
"Million dollars question: where do you go on a Saturday evening after a delightful and refined tea service with your girlfriends? Well - get a greasy burger with your hubby of course!!! It's pathetic, I know. But I hadn't had a burger in......ages.....and I was really craving one. But a cheap one. And close to Binny's (no twisted reason there, we just happened to be close to Binny's. That. is. it.) Epic Burger being featured in TOC as 'best lunch spot in the Loop' it caught my dinner companion attention and he drove me there. I was way over-dressed for it but what the heck?!? Let's dig in, get all dirty and makes dry-cleaners rich and happy!!! Turned out: I was pleasantly surprised. So yes the decor is a little heavy on the kitsch and looks like an Ikea lost in Disneyland but the fare they",5

"My godmother threw an engagement party for my fiancee and me at Gioco and it was a fantastic time!  The party was in their back room that was the first thing that impressed everyone.  The room is small but has tons of character and it was the first thing everyone commented on. Apparently Al Capone and his buddies used to play poker or gamble back here and there are still drawings of him and others on the walls.  The walls are all exposed brick, the room is pretty dark, and it just set the perfect backdrop for our party.  The only downfall was that it did get a little warm back there with all the guests, but we managed. The staff were the next great thing about Gioco's.  Completely attentive and friendly, our wine glasses were never empty and the pours were more than generous (we of course ",5
"My family 'popped' into town from Texas.  Since they were coming in from the Millennium Park train station, I found this tiny Giordano's on Yelp!  Who knew that this tiny location even existed?   The hostess was super accommodating to our group that grew in size and was then 20 minutes late.  Our pizzas took awhile but that is deep dish for ya.  I wish that they would have come around to ask us about dessert a bit earlier: I always make my nieces and nephew get some delish cheesecake while they are in town.  When they brought it out, I had to ask for the check immediately so that they wouldn't miss their train. I would definitely come back!",4
"Call me a tourist for stopping by and grabbing some to take home to LA. Hell, I don't even really eat popcorn to begin with. For a large bag, it was only $8.25. I was tempted to grab the jumbo but I didn't want to go overboard. Maybe I should've though because the coworkers ate it up with a mad quickness for breakfast this morning. I wanted to play it safe and so I went with the Chicago Mix: caramel crisp & cheese corn popcorn. This sweet & salty combination is a perfect balance like yin & yang. You can't go wrong with ordering this. I did sample caramel crisp with almond. Also, very very good. I'm sure the other flavors are solid as well. There's a reason why when you get on that plane to go home and you see people carrying bags from Garrett's. We're tourists and that shizzle isn't easily",4
"Pretty cool place for an after work dinner and beers. I stopped in here yesterday with a colleague after first heading to Berghoff and finding it totally jammed. I thought the service was perfectly fine, not awesome but not unfriendly or slow. I had bangers and mash, pretty much my standard British pub meal and was not disappointed. The bangers were authentic and yummy, mash and beans were as expected. My London Porters Jack & Cokes were fine too, although my last Jack & Coke was kind of a stingy pour. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to stop by here but if you're in the Loop and want a solid, affordable meal and a couple of pints, E&C is worth a try.",4
"Again, a great pizza place with an extensive menu. If you're only in Chicago for one night, get the deep dish and you won't regret it. I know it sounds weird to have sauce on the top of your pizza, but it's easily the best item on their menu. I've gotten both take-out and eaten at this location, and the service is great, the portions are generous, and it was easily the best food I ate in Chicago (I ate there twice in five days).",4
"They have a pretty good asian beef salad here... on a nice day its fun to sit outside and people watch!",4
"I  thought I would give Epic a try, I work just down the block.  A bunch of my co-workers and I checked it out.  I ordered a Portebello burger for $5.99.  Huge mushroom on a Delicious whole wheat bun, good Epic special sauce, normal burger fix ins and add Wisconsin cheddar for .89.  a bag of hand cut fries is $2 but is huge and can easily be shared.   I loved my burger, very tasty.  Fries were good too. All meats are naturally raised and they seemed to care about the environment (disposable silverware that was corn based and bio degradable ) but the recycling can was no where to be found..hmmm Over all my co-workers and I enjoyed our burgers and they were Epic in proportion.  I will go back and split a burger and fries!",4
"$4.69 for the #3 (Totally Tuna) or the #6 (Vegetarian). Tuna's a little watery but very good, and I love the Veggie, even if their avocado 'spread' is barely noticeable. The bread is so fresh - and I am NOT a bread lover - and I love any sandwich with some sprouts thrown on.  (Oh, to live in CA and be able to get avocado/sprout sandwiches regularly!) I'm just really confused as to why 1) they cannot cut the sandwich in half, even if you ask them to, and 2) they cannot put the sandwich in a bag for you, even if you say it's to go.",4
"Really good quality food, much better than expected.  The burgers are fantastic.  Properly cooked and very tasty.  Lots of seating, too.  I've never had to wait.",4
"Giordano's.  Pizza.  Stuffed.  Me.  Stuffed.  Pure satisfaction. So, I went here on a convention once and boy was I pleased.  You cannot get stuffed pizza this good anywhere on the west coast.  So we're all kind of buzzed from the nice cool pitcher(s) of beer that we managed to polish off while they were baking our 14' large stuffed pie, and we have some friends from Southern California there, and they are absolutely starving, and we sort of forgot to tell them that they give you forks and knives for a reason.  Hot pizza sauce, short pants, good times.",4
"Came here last night for dinner. They sat 7 of us right away and the service was excellent. Very attentive, but not overbearing. Food has improved also. Herb chicken sandwhich was great. It paired well with the $3 bud light bottles.",4
"Worth getting a reservation and baby sitter. We have had the pleasure of dining here on three separate occasions. All of our visits have been dinners and I personally can attest to the fact that their seasonal specials  are worth a shot. Pricey, but you get what you pay for here. Wine selection was perfect thanks to the suggestion from our server. We will return.",4
"I so wanted to hate this place; don't even ask why because I don't know.  However, it was delicious and fulfilled all of my fantasies of eating a dripping wet...all-natural...burger. I have to admit, for a 'fast-food' joint, it was darn G-O-O-D.  Granted, half way through my burger, I had the special sauce on my suit and an empty bun from where all the meat used to be.  But, I can't complain; it just meant that somehow I was eating so fast that I lost sight of the burger/bun ratio.  The fries were decent, although I do like Patty's fries better.   The food gets 5 stars, but the girl at the counter was rude to me even though I was the only one in line and she took forever to even acknowledge me(hmmm...) so the one star is dropped for that.",4
"Ah Chicago Deep Dish Pizza. As a Californian, who prefers her pizza thin crusted, Exchequer is an excellent way to dive in. Our servers were kind, and attentive and lively to us, so we felt very welcomed on our first night in Chi-town. Also! They were super helpful. I think they cater to a lot of tourists. We ordered a salad for an appetizer, which was pretty standard, and the drinks, especially beer was great. I don't recommend the mix drinks as my friend's Key Lime martini looked pretty gross, and according to her, it was. D: At last our pizza came, and Exchequer serves the kind without the pizza sauce on top, so this pizza is just cheesy goodness. The crust was baked well and the cheese was yummy. Exchequer allows you to design your own pizza, so there are many toppings. You can even go",5
"Tried the Orange-A-Peel, it was o-k. Not too sweet, but kind of lacked flavor, in my opinion. Still love the Pomegranate-Pick-Me-Up, its tangy with little sweetness had it a few times again. Still love my new discovery of the world of Jamba Juice!",4
"Opulent, excellent views, remarkable food and service. Let's start with the clarification....the French are all about presentation, bread and wine!  That being said, if you want Grand Lux Cafe portions and pricing, it is not far away. We notified the waiter of my nut and seafood allergies and I was still offered the tasting menu with modifications.  The wine parings were flawless!  I was also informed that if I notify the the day before, they will have any souffle I request prepared. I loved this place!",5
"I was told that this was the best Deep Dish Pizza in Chicago, so you know I had to go. There are about 30 locations in Chicago, so finding one nearby was easy. They have every type of pizza you could imagine from thin crust to the Chicago style deep dish. I opted for the Chicago classic deep dish. BTW, I now know why they call it a PIE. After waiting 40 minutes for my freshly baked pizza/pie, I cut into this thing of beauty. Cheese and toppings oozed out (it reminded me of a chocolate lava dessert with the warm center pouring out). I couldn't wait a minute longer, I tried to pick up a piece and barely made it to my mouth...MMM, this stuff was good, real good. I loved the texture of this pizza. There is crust, then toppings, then crust, then toppings again. A double whammy of deliciousness.",4
"For this life-long Chicagoan, visiting a traditional Windy City hot dog joint is like putting on an old soft sweater or a worn pair of Levi's - it is pure comfort. It has been a few years since I visited one of the Gold Coast Dog establishments. I've always liked these places even though they don't serve the best hot dog around they are always consistent and good. Today I found the Gold Coast Dogs on Wabash and Randolph and to my surprise it was empty at noon. I was greeted by the hot dog man with the traditional scowl and inability to recall my order shortly after receiving it. I think this behavior has been passed on from the gurus of Maxwell Street circa 1888 to successive generations of hot dog vendors. It is a sign that you are in a good place, it is a sign that you are going to get a",5
"We stopped in here after our field trip to the Shedd Aquarium, and I loved it! What a fun place! I love the old diner feel... it is a little loud, very lively and has a good lunch crowd. We sat down at the booth and perused the menu, which has EVERYTHING. Breakfast all day? Yes. Please pass the pancakes! I had their Cobb Salad, and it wasn't too bad. The ingredients were very fresh, and I always appreciate large chunks of blue cheese. My work peeps had the burgers and a tuna melt. Food was great overall. My only complaint was that the service was super slow. But I guess that can be expected in a busy diner! I will definitely be back to try their monster chocolate malt shake!",4
"The pizza at Giordano's is very good.  Deep dish is the only way to go.  They should remove thin crust from the menu to force all customers to choose deep dish. We went here last Sunday with a group of 17.  Initially the wait seemed insurmountable, but they encourage you to submit your pizza order while you are waiting so your ZA can be ready when you are seated.  I think it only took us 50 minutes to be seated.  Then we still waited another 40 minutes or so for the pizzas.  But the pizza was great.  I wish I were eating it right now.  We ordered the spinach pizza (which I didn't try, but it received many thumbs up from my party), the special or supreme (which I did try and it was excellent), the pepperoni (which was also delish) and cheese (which had to be good, its a deep dish of cheese ",4

"Excellent spot in the loop for a beer.  Whether it be post-work, mid-shopping, or for a liquidy lunch. I stopped here Friday with my parents because my dad needed some relief after my mom and I tore up State Street.  I had a bloody and a Miller - both par for the course.  My mom and I split pub pretzels which were very tasty (especially that mustard - rock!) but they kind of reminded me of donuts (not that that is a BAD thing).   The service was spot-on and I loved the English pub decor.  As a loop lady ALWAYS on the lookout for a happy-hour spot, I will be back to this bar very soon.",5
"Love me some goodwin's!!  They have some of the most unique sandwiches in the city.  I like other standards like their Reuben type sandwich.  Always delicious.  You could go here for a month straight and probably have something different every day and be quite happy. The line can be a little long at times... but it moves along. And it's inexpensive.",4
"The reason for the four stars is the actual taste of the meal I enjoyed there yesterday.  It was good--lox and eggs, potatoes and bagel.  The eggs were fluffy and the lox a generous portion.  I appreciated the choice between regular lox and nova, and I picked nova for my tastes.  The potatoes were good and reheated well.   The bagel was just ok.  I was asked if I wanted to substitute for toast and said, of course, sesame seed please.  But it arrived with NO CREAM CHEESE.  Not even any butter.  In a place that's at least trying to approximate a Jewish deli, that's a big stumble.  And since the person who delivered my food wasn't my server, my request for cream cheese was met with a blank look.   Also, the coffee was tepid.  I'm sure it was warm at some point--but being served morning coffee",4
"Yum, yum YUMMM!!!  I love the deep dish cheese and spinach- it is truly to die for.  The restaurant is pretty hole in the wall but who cares when you're getting a great pizza?!  This is my second favorite pizza in the city, after Chicago's.  Prices are definitely not cheap tho!",4
"Giordano's isn't exactly deep dish but it is my favorite non-thin crust pizza in Chicago.  Unlike Uno's, all Giordano's pizzas taste the same no matter which location you go to.  So nice to know it is always going to taste good! The problem with the pizza is that I can never have more than 2 pieces.  But lucky me that I always have leftovers the next day.",4
"Been here a few times and had a good experience both times. The place is very warm and friendly...though i can't get over how low the ceilings are. I think that is what makes the place appear smaller than what it actually is. Pictures of famous British people/things on the walls. I like that they have fireplaces to warm you up on cold Chicago winter nights. Food is pretty good. I have only had their chicken pot pie (delicious), but my boyfriend had their steak and he said it was really good. Love it how his steak came with beans, fries and onion rings! Ummm...can we get anymore british...i think not! My only complaint when it comes to the food is that our spinach dip was not great. Taste-wise it was ok....but it came out all sticky like it had been sitting there for awhile and was only sli",4

Decor isn't anything special, but, it has a warm, feel to it with a lot of history. The food was alright. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Alfredo. It was pretty tasty but I've had better... and worse. One thing I loved however, was that the waitress left a shaker of Parmesan Cheese at the table. Little things like that make me happy.",4
"Stuffed crust pizza is delicious.  My boyfriend wanted pepperoni on it, which seemed to only add grease to an otherwise perfect pizza.  The only problem was that there was too much food (not a bad thing) and our drive home was too long to make bringing the leftovers with us safe.  On a side note, the bathrooms were a disastrous mess.",5

"Jen took me here for my birthday. Everest sits atop the 40th floor of the Chicago Stock exchange at the corner of the South-west loop, and the Chicago sky-line views are beautiful. Not to be outmatched, the food was perfectly amazing. When the first course arrived I was worried that the small portions would be inadequate for a full meal. By course #12 though, I was perfectly stuffed. The waiter was attentive, and kind. Not too snobby or pushy. My only complaint is that he did not adequately explain the prix-fix menu. From ignorance we ordered a 'special' desert, which was $25 extra. But it turned out that the prix-fix dessert was tastier than the 'special' souffl.  That aside, given the opportunity I'd go back in a heart-beat.

Some have complained about the lack of menu options.  Personally, I like that they stick to what they know and don't put a ton of salads in the fridge case or try to sell things they are not good at.  Simply menu is the way to go. A little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it if you enjoy a good burger that was grass fed and treated humanely.  Some have mentioned that they should be paying less because it is a ",5

The food is freshly made, and they're willing to take requests.  For $7 you can get a heaping portion of an entree, fried rice and either a crab rangoon or egg roll.   One of the best 'fast food' Chinese places around, and certainly a better value than some chain place like Panda Express.",5
"This is a top-of-the line dining establishment.  The restaurant is located high up in an office tower and has wonderful views of the City.  The food is fabulous and the wine list is overwhelming.  It's all great.  Pricing adds up to a bill that is likely larger than the annual budget of a small country.  Service is impeccable.",5

I was walking down Mich Ave with a certain lovely lady, and pho was brought up,  and Yelp brought us here. The food court location (entrance is located on Lake right next to the McDonald's) made me a bit skeptical at first. The portions were pho-nominal and it all tasted great to me. I particularly enjoyed the brown sauce that it came with (similar to teriyaki) for mixing in. Bean sprouts and Asian basil came on the side. I enjoyed my first pho experience here. Now I will be searching out the next best place to get it in the city as winter is upon us. Truly warms the soul.",5
"Wow! now that was a deep-dish pizza!  So large, and so cheesy.  It really was an eye-opening experience for a first-time Chicago visitor.  Luckily, there are many locations around town, to spread the wealth of their signature dish. This place is always crowded around dinner, expect a 30-40 minute wait for small groups.  Ingeniously, they allow you to pre-order your pizzas because deep-dish ones take 45 mins to cook. You know those pizza commercials, where the slice comes out of the box with the cheese sticking to the other slices?  that doesn't happen in real life.  Well it happens with these guys!

Make sure you make reservations beforehand and request a seat by the window -- you don't want to miss this spectacular view of the city.",5

"THE BEST Chicago Deep Dish pizza... hands down.  I especially like the spinach one.  If I have out of town guest who want to try Chicago style pizza, I take them here. Now, there are some things you do have to note: 1.  If you are going to eat here, make sure that you like the person that you a going here with.  The wait for seating can be long.  If you are ordering a deep dish pizza, it does take 45- 1 hour to cook. 2.  See note above, do not stuff yourself on salad or drinks because 3.  One slice of deep dish pizza is a meal.  No, seriously.  All that cheesy tomato goodness is A LOT.  This is Chicago Style Pizza!!  This Pizza is thick and hearty enough to start a bar brawl.

It gets very crowded here, so best come early, or be willing to wait at least an hour before you get seated.  And then another 30-45 min for the pizza to actually cook.  Everything is made fresh to order, and when it gets to your table, it is piping hot.  It's cool that they serve it on a stool-like thing to make it easier for the servers to cut the pizza.  For many people, 1 slice is enough to satiate your hunger for pizza and make you come crawling back for more next time. I'd have to say the best thing about the pizza is that since the cheese is on the bottom, and the toppings mixed in the marina",5

"This place is fantastic whether you're introducing visitors to a local Chicago restaurant, entertaining clients or want a beautiful evening for two.  The ambiance can be as romantic as you make it or as enjoyable as you would like and the wine list will impress your selective palette. I've tried the Gnocchi (carb loading evening), the Salmon (my steady eddy) with fresh vegetables and those with me rave on an on about their steak, talapia and pastas. All in all, there's nothing we have every ordered that's been a miss.  However, there's one thing everyone has to order whenever I go and it's the asparagus risotto (careful it's got white wine and can be addictive)! If you're looking for a great evening out and enjoy making the dining experience the center of your evening, this is a wonderful ",5
"Continuing on my Michelin star restaurant quest and admitting up front that this review is biased based on comparison to the other Michelin star restaurants at which I have dined. See all reviews of the list here http://bit.ly/nGR9Vc Most relevant comparisons: L2O (quality of food, value relative to others); Sixteen (decor highlighted by beautiful views); Avenues (Service and staff) but unlike Avenues, Everest is not CLOSED now. Everest, while an absolutely fantastic experience I would recommend to friends, colleagues, and anyone who asks, was not good enough to win me over either Avenues at the Peninsula or Les Nomades. I do, however, think it had better food than Alinea, better service than L2O, and a better overall experience than Ria. If you love French food, and can only try one uber ",4

"I don't even like pizza, because my teens eat it so much, so I really didn't want to go eat pizza on vacation. The stuffed super veggie pizza was wonderful! I loved it. the teens had pepperoni/sausage and we were all so happy and satisfied. Glad we stopped and had the famed Chicago pizza! yummy!",5

"I haven't been to this chain since the 80s and thought they had all closed down for some reason. In any event, the deserve 5*s for not only returning pretzels to normalcy (i.e. with salt) but for raising the bar to awesome new heights.   The deep-fried pretzel!   It is so fantastic.  I can't stop thinking of it. And you get three.  So good!",5

"I am such a fan of Eleven City Diner. I have went there with my mom, friends, and my bf. They are prompt and nice. The food is to die for. This building actually used to be a bank which my mom used to work. I was awed in how they made it a diner. Sometimes it is really crowded and other times it is not really crowded. I personally love the milkshakes, patty melt, red velvet cake, and matzo ball soup.. These are some must-haves! There was only one gripe I had. Last time I was there the waitress bombarded me with a nasty attitude. I had to give her five dollars to get her off my back. Other than that, I had overall good experiences with this diner. Run like forest gump and get to this place!",5
"While in Chicago last week, the girlfriend and I decided to meet up with a friend at the Eleven City Diner while in town. She had been there before and kept telling us it isn't like any other diner, and boy was she right. This place was simply amazing, especially for a bunch of Jews. Although this place isn't kosher, it has tons of Judaica stuff all over the place. They have He'brew beer displayed everywhere and also sell Heeb magazine. We showed up and there was a bit of a wait, but I will definitely not let this hurt the review. The guy taking down the names (I believe he was the owner), about every 10 minutes screamed out the current waiting list and where you stand on it. This was very nice, because you always wonder how much longer you have to wait. He also kept offering to let people",4
"Seems like Chicago has alot of winners. Bears, White Sox, and now popcorn champions, Garrett's. Their sweet n' salty combination is delicious. A tad greasy but made with freshness and awesomeness. A little warning..... STUFF IS ADDICTING. My sister and I ate a whole tin before we knew it! The best is when you eat them in the same grab. But, the caramel and cheese popcorns are excellent in their own right as well. Be prepared to wait tho, the line was almost out the door when I went around 8pm on a friday night.",5
"This pizza is to die for!! Deep dish like no where else! Now that I moved away from Chicago I miss this pizza so much and can't find anything like it!! I might have to get some shipped out here!  =)   It is very filling and does take a while to cook but its worth the wait!  (they are baking this pizza its like a cake) It can hit the spot with friends and family, everyone needs to try it!",5
"Simply put they only had one pizza crust left so we all shared the pizza as an appetizer and it was obvious why there was only one left once I took my first bite. YUM! The fish of the day was delicious, the wait staff was friendly, excellent wine selection, and guests here would certainly feel comfortable dressed up or dressed slightly down.

"Oh baby, thinking about the deep dish makes me hungry right now. I can still taste the tomato sauce, the cheese and the yummy delicious crust. My friend and I made a point to stop here after doing the museum and shopping...it takes about 35 minutes to cook a small deep dish and we waited patiently. Our server in the bar was super cool and was kind enough to take pictures for us. The pizza totally lives up to the hype. It's damn good. We ate here around 445pm....but we only ate one slice each because we had 930 reservations at Charlie Trotters....such good pizza to go to waste. So, knowing that we wouldn't eat the rest in our hotel later, we boxed that baby to go, just to give it to a bum outside somewhere. Sure enough, as we walked out and walked towards Michigan Ave a bum asked 'do you ha",5
"Great little grease factory in the south loop, just  a block and half away from the Harold Washington branch of the Chicago Public Library. Actually a decent value, I've paid more for a burger and fries in the suburbs. Fantastic mozzarella sticks too. The inside is small, maybe 9-10 tables and a 3-4 person bar. In the summer they set up a few outdoor tables. If you come during normal lunch times be prepared to get creative in your eating location.",5
"Dude I was in Chicago for only like 5 days.  I went to a couple pizza joints and this place was the illest!   We had the most rad righteous pizza here, all you haters, come on now, just cause you had to wait long don't got nothin' on the pizza!   The feelin' was there, the vibe was fun and crowded and the pizza was on point for sure.  The deep dish....oh their deep dish, I guess I could go on and on about how it saved my life but you are just gonna have to check in. I spec the locals know a thing or two aboot pizza, but for us out-of-townies Giordano's is like finding a suit case full of money in a ditch near your house.",5
"I recently took on the challenge of evaluating and ranking almost all of Goodwin's wraps over a 2-month period. You may notice that I have avoided most of the veggie wraps since I am a meat eater. I must say that all of the wraps, except veggie, are fantastic and I would gladly eat the bottom ranked wraps before I settled for Subway. Here are the ranks and findings: 1. Santa Rosa - Great for the winter. A very soft bite. 2. Key West - Great for the summer. Pineapple is refreshing. 3. The Vail - Great name. Basic BBQ. 4. The Flagstaff - Very similar to the Santa Rosa. 5. Nogales 6. Santa Fe - Boar's Head Roast Beef is so pure. Light amount of tomatoes. 7. The Tahoe - I was not expecting to like this one, but the turkey walnut salad was very good. The walnut taste shines through. 8. Caesar W",5

I lived just north of Chicago for about a year and I would travel about 1 hour by train and walk there almost every weekend or whenever I got the chance.The pizza is phenomenal my  buddies would have a little challenge going to see who could eat the most; needless to say he ended up finishing a medium by himself.",5
"I can be very addicted to cheese corn. I always liked Chicago's Jay's Okedoke cheese corn --in fact,so much that I once ordered a case of it when I was living in Cali. Everyone laughed, but it beat out all the cheese corns I could find there. As far as I know, there aren' t many popcorn houses in Cali. Could never find anything decent. That's why, whenever I came to downtown Chicago, I'd get me a bag 'o Chicago Mix Garrett's popcorn! There is cheese corn ... and then there is Garett's! OMG. Cheese,cheese, cheese. A cheese person's heaven. The caramel corn is VERY sweet which is why the cheese corn cuts it so well. I actually don't eat much at a time because it is so satisfying. YUM. I bought some today and even tho the store was empty -- it was the middle of a weekday -- they almost forgot",5

"Ahhhh....This is my favorite pizza in the whole wide world. I go to a lot of Giordanos (including this one, Midway airport location and Franklin & Randolph) but have been to this one the most. The stuffed sausage is my favorite along with the stuffed Spinach also. Their thin crust pizza is pretty good as well. They have a bar if you are interested in having a drink.During lunch you can get a personal pizza to go which is always great if you are in a hurry, but you can't get it after 5PM.

"I now live in DC, and among the many reasons why I miss Chicago, Giordano's is one of them.  Every time I come home, I demand that my parents have a fresh hot Giordano's pizza waiting for me. There are a lot of good options when it comes to Chicago-style pizza (I'm also a fan of Gino's East and Pizzeria Uno... or Due) but Giordano's is hands-down my favorite.  I love the stuffed pizza concept and it comes out to an amazing slice of pizza.  I'm pretty simple when it comes to my pizza, so I usually just get the stuffed cheese, and I'm in heaven every time.  The crust is nice and hearty, so if you're still not full by the time you're done with your pizza (an unlikely story, but it's been known to happen) then you can easily fill up on that.  The cheese is warm and gooey and plentiful, and I c",5

From the cheesiness, to the sauce on top, the crust....best part is, they deliver!",5
"On our visit to Chicago we tried Lou Malnati's on N Wells St & Giordano's on E Lake St. I really liked Lou Malnati's but I LOVED the pizza at Giordano's! You do wait 35 minutes, so if you want to call ahead that would speed things up. I had the spinach & cheese & my husband had the pepperoni & olives. We ordered individual lunch sizes, and I have to say that if you are really hungry, I would go for a small size instead of the individual. When I return to Chicago, I will definitely be going back to Giordano's! :)",5

When it's sweltering and nauseatingly hot outside, I sometimes don't eat (or don't go out) because I'm too delicate to be beaten by the cruel, cruel sun. I just can't stand it. Today, I ordered my sandwich online. Quick and easy! There are also vegetable choices here (cucumber, sprouts) that I never think of getting in the store (where I often have to repeat my order four times and forget stuff). I swear my sandwich got to me in ten minutes. No apparently delivery fee - how do they do this? And the delivery guy was adorable.",5

I was so full from only one slice that my family and I (3 of us in total) had to take the rest of the individual pizza (said to serve 1-2 people) to go. The service is friendly, but once the restaurant gets busy (by 1pm, the whole place was PACKED for lunch), the service is slow and frustrating. I don't blame the waitresses since they have to manage 10 tables at once, but with such a successful chain, you'd think the managers would hire some more help to please their numerous customers.",5

When we go I always order the Springer on Challah (they won't tell us who makes their fabulous Challah bread!) and it is always terrific.

I was visiting friends who live in Chicago, and they took me to dinner here, saying it's 'The' Chicago Pizza. Went just before 7 on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy understandably - wait time was 30-45 minutes, but you can pre-order, so our pizza was ready almost as soon as we sat down - it was really not a bad waiting experience at all. We got a medium for us two girls and my friend's husband - she and I had two pieces and that is PLENTY, and her husband had 3 - I think there was even leftover, so don't worry about not being satisfied!

Next to Charlie Trotter's iconic restaurant, Everest stands as perhaps the most well known elder statesman in a dining scene dominated by cutting edge technique and 'hyper-modern' cuisine.  While both styles clearly have their place in 21st century dining, Chicago's predilection for molecular gastronomy somehow makes a place such as Everest stand out in a way it may not in San Francisco or New York.  Other factors that makes Everest stand out - its glorious location on the 40th floor of the Chicago Stock Exchange, four star reviews by the Tribune and Sun Times, designations by Relais & Chateaux/Relais Gourmand, Traditions & Qualite, and Le Grande Table du Monde - and just days ago, a Michelin Star.   Beginning the meal proper, approximately 25 m",5

It was 7pm on a Wednesday and we were told it woould be 15-30 minutes (other places quoted me at least an hour) so my wife and I packed up our kids and quickly walked to Giordano's.  When we got there, the line was out the door and the hostess informed me that it would be at LEAST an hour wait, maybe 1-1/2 hours.  My jaw dropped and I explained that I had been told by one of their employees on the phone, just 10 minutes prior, that the wait would only be 15-30 minutes.  About this time, another employee, Bailey F., stepped up to the podium to listened to my plea, looked at my very hungry, young kids (It was an hour past their dinner time), pulled the hostess aside and th",5

This particular individual about whom Dion was complaining was charged $18 for a Remy and cranberry juice, which is ridiculous. I can only assume that is the reason the individual tipped lightly.  But, that was none of my business because my friends and I had been leaving hefty tips all evening.

"Dear Deep Dish Pizza lovers and aspiring Chicago Pizza Tourists: Giordano's is the McDonald's of Chicago deep dish pizza.  Their thin crust is doughy and bland.  The dough in their deep dish has way too much sugar in it.  If you like safe, conservative and tasteless pizza, you might like G's (see Pizza Hut).  But if you want flavor and quality, look to Gino's, Uno's and Lou Malnati's.   For some torturous godforsaken reason, the company I used to work for would order this shit over and over when there's Pat's, Aurellio's and Gino's nearby.   Btw, if you want some thin crust recommendations, PM me, and my answers will be mom & pop shops, not corporate crap.  Hmmm...let's exit this review with 'peace out!'

I've witnessed more drama between Brad and the staff than I can recall.  Some of the memorable bits include dressing-downs of the hostesses in front of the large waiting weekend crowds, screams lobbed across the restaurant, and awkward, unnecessarily confrontational encounters between Brad and customers confused by his many rules.

The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary.

Not  only does this guy walk around the restaurant talking way too loud and bossing his staff around unnecessarily, but he also is constantly coming up to tables and talking to them for too long while they are trying to eat (classic arti buco move). Nothing is worse than having to talk to a hugely intense douche while you are trying to eat. Secondly while i was eating at the front window table i watched the owner as he",1
"Im truly disappointed in any one who wrote a good review for this establishment.  The prices are ridiculous the burgers are not cooked to order the fries were soggy and under seasoned the burger was flavorless and worst of all my egg was cold overcooked and broken!  The strawberry shake was good staff was friendly but 27 bucks for two people all I can say is Im disappointed and who ever thinks this place is good has never been to kumas",1
"I ordered from this Edwardo's once and have never gone back since.  The deep-dish Spinach was horrible!  Something just wasn't right with the cheese, it was as if they mixed something really foul tasting with the mozzarella, I couldn't exactly put my finger on it but it just really gave the whole pizza an awful after-taste.  It's really a shame, I remember going to one of these years ago out in Elmhurst and thought it was fantastic.",1
"If you like your smoothies with ice and fruit chunks, come here. I adore Jamba Juice, but I cannot stand when my smoothies have chunks in them! This is the only location where repeatedly their blender does not work, so go a few extra blocks to get to another Jamba Juice. It's worth it.",1
"Ick. Ball of cheese. I went with three friends on a recent trip to Chicago and we all thought the pizza needed more crust, more filling, and more sauce; anything but more cheese! We all left feeling sad and confused- is that really what Chicago deep dish is supposed to be like? I've certainly enjoyed the deep dish I've had in other cities, including San Francisco, much better.",1

"On december 27, 2011 my family and my father that just came from Costa Rica went to your restaurant located in Jackson. Sorry to say but we had the worst meal ever and it was not about the food. It was due a little complain about the pizza we ordered. We order the veggie without broccoli and we get the pizza with the broccoli plus the 45 minutes to get the order completed. The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged. I talked to the manager and he said that he did not approved anything and he directly said that we ",1
"My husband and I liked this place at first, we moved from the East Coast to the South Loop and 11th city reminded us of diners at home.  The food was always overpriced but the service usually made up for it so we went somewhat frequently.  The more we went the more we were turned off by the obnoxious owner/manager whoever he is.  If you've ever eaten there, you know who I'm talking about.  The last time we were there, we brought some friends that were visiting from NY.  As we were finishing up the owner sat down at our table and asked if we minded if he fixed his boot.  We were all a little confused as to why that was necessary but as he sits down he says, 'So is this your first time here?'  I answered that we had been there before, and his response, 'OH So why do you keep coming back?'  R",1
"It would be great place to stop for popcorn, except for three panhandlers who are regulars there in front of the Jackson Street shop, bothering all the Garrett customers for money to 'help a brother out' and then sneer at them and verbally insult  customers when they try to ignore them.

"Ugh. I'm surprised this place has such a high rating right now. I used to eat here quite a bit (mainly because it's the closest restaurant to where I worked). It's expensive for what you get - you pay quite a bit of change for a huge plate of bland, sub par food. I've tried quite a few of their menu items - their pancakes are dry and spongy, their cakes are dry as well. I got fed up with the lack of quality in the food and the fact that my carryout order was almost always screwed up. The only thing I ended up eating there near the end of my 11 City stint was the cheese fries. Now, the cheese is good. However, they always managed to (somehow) screw up the fries. Cold. Burned. When I came to the realization that this place had issues cooking fries,  I stopped eating here. The wait-staff is r",1
"We stood at the door a good 5 minutes before someone seated us. We should have walked out then. We ordered the curry chips appetizer after our rude waitress asked 'OK So what do you want?'. The curry chips sounded so awesome - fries and curry sauce. I love the madras curry flavor and England is one place to get it. What we actually got was a different story - they served the fries next to a bowl of chunky potato curry that was not very saucy. We actually asked our server if she was kidding us. Did they expect us to skewer the curried potatoes with our 'chips'? I ordered one of the winter special drinks - called a cinnamon toast. It tasted like very watery (bland) cider. I don't find many places in the city that water down their drinks - because they normally cost you $10. The beer list was",1
"i was there as an extra in a commercial shoot and asked if they had any gluten-free options.  the woman behind the bar told me they actually had gluten-free fish & chips that were made with corn flour.  amazed, i asked if they were fried in a dedicated fryer as well, and she said yes!  so i was super excited, ordered them, scarfed them down, and literally a half hour later started to feel the unmistakable first signs of gluten.  I was so ill I had to leave the shoot, and I spent the day very sick, and the following weeks fighting symptoms.  all I can think is that possibly the fryers ARE shared, or that somehow I was given gluten-free fish, but maybe fries from a normal fryer that has breaded items fried in it.  regardless, tough lesson to learn.  i hadn't had fish & chips in about 9 years",1
"This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE only: I live across the street from this place and eat here often.  Usually, i just get the pizza for carry out.  I HATE the fact that they want to charge you for gardinaire peppers when their counterparts in the suburbs are so friendly about it.  This place specifically really needs to work on its customer service.  When you're charging 22 dollars for a large stuffed spinach, a small cup of gardinaire isn't going to kill you, and you can't count it as a topping since my g/f only wants it for her slices (2).   Secondly, I ate there last night on a dine in basis, and the service was also horrible.  I left a note at the end that said 'Why your tip stinks' and I listed the following reasons: They never refilled my water.   I asked for gardinaire pepper",1
"This has truly been one of the worst pizza delivery experiences I have ever had. I ordered a pizza at 5.10pm which of course doesn't arrive before the hour is out (whoever said Pizza was 'fast food' hasn't heard about today's pizza places). The thin crust pizza that arrives is overcooked to the point of the pizza crust being brown (brown cheese really?) and no salt or flavor on anything. I call to complain and of course they tell me I need to wait another hour to get a replacement. Clearly my displeasure doesn't matter to them because they know people won't wait that long. I also decline to wait but I want my money back. They agree to take the pizza and give me a refund provided its not been eaten. How can I know that it tastes bad unless I've tried a slice; I told the person on the line t",1
"I had been to Emerald a couple of times and thought it was a typical, mediocre downtown bar that would be universally loved (as all Irish bars are). I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice! After another attempt to order a drink it w",1

"The last time I went to a Johnny Rocket was when there was one at the Rush and Division area, I'd get an awesome ham and cheese, fries and a chocolate malt- When the one opened on State was anxious to give it a try- The place is split b/t Halsted St. Deli and Johnny Rockets, I don't think they have everything on the menu like the old one did- I ordered a single cheeseburger and a chocolate malt-Let's just say I wasted $10 today-The cheeseburger was gross, I think McDonald's is better than this-It didn't have any taste, I mean nothing at all-The cheese was so gross, and the chocolate malt...well I couldn't taste the malt and where was the chocolate taste? So I will never go here again and will tell people to go to Portillo's for a nice thin and cheesy burger-",1
"We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer.  The calamari  were small, over breaded, tasted mushy and left lots of bread crumbs on the bottom of the dish. I felt like I was at a crappy fish 'n' chips joint.  I started wondering if  professional chefs were cooking or just some dudes off the street. For the main course I had the New York Strip in a red wine sauce. It came with diced potatoes mixed with onions and garlic on the side. My husband had the Prime Ribeye that came with mashed potatoes. We were both very unimpressed. My potatoes were hard and cold. For a second I though I was eating a Stouffer's frozen dinner. The only good thing about our meal was the bottle of Chianti we ordered.",1
"This place is alright... if you're desperate. I tried this place out for lunch and drinks with a big group and this place was awful. When we were first seated, there was this awful smell that smelled like dog crap. Our waitress was really crabby. Like I said, I went with a big group (which meant automatic 18 percent tip added to the final bill) but yet the waitress was incredibly rude and bitchy. I noticed they had a chicken sandwich special on their board and when I asked questions about it she said that she didn't know what was in it and then made up some bull**** lie that they were all out of the special (I knew this was a lie because we came in when the place first opened). She then took forever to get us our drinks and food and never once did she apologize. Further, she was nice to ev",1

First, we stood waiting at the entrance for what felt like forever while servers and bartenders passed us without an acknowledgment.  Apparently the idea of host or hostess never occurred to Encore.  There were two other couples and a group of 4 also waiting and looking a little disgruntled.  Not even a host stand - the bartender came over and seated us and spent the rest of the time acting as host, bartender and our crappy server. After finally seated it took about 10 minutes for him to come back with our drinks and take our order.  This is loop lunch people - I have to be back in my office and your laid back ti",1

"I came here because of the great reviews on Chowhound, but I wish someone had told me the following:  At Giordano's you will pay $25+ for a small pizza that tastes like cardboard.  Literally, the pizza is cooked on cardboard.  This is a huge no-no for flavor and texture. Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable.  I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least.  This happen to anyone else?

"OK.  We just got back to NY from Chicago last night and I just reviewed Glenn's Diner and Yolk (both very good) and I had to put my 2 cents in about this place too.  I saw Giordano's on TV and I have to say that THE PIZZA SUCKS here.  Even if I didn't think that NY pizza rules, the crust here was just awful and the tomato sauce tastes like the crap you get if you are dumb enough to order Italian food at a diner.  We went to Lou Malnati's a few days earlier and that was pretty good (for deep dish pizza, that is) as were the other dishes we saw people eating there.  Other people near us at Giordano's ordered other dishes and they looked just awful too (a plate of fried, really greasy looking appetizers, calamari that looked tough and hard).  I mentioned to my husband that I hoped that their ",1

"We heard the hype of this place. It was recommended by more than a few of our local friends. After waiting for over 1.5 hours, we finally got our pizza, and were floored by how underwhelming it was! Mountains of rubbery mozzarella cheese, no sauce, nothing good, let alone extraordinary! Crust sucked, veggies were soggy and droopy...meat was nothing special.  The tastiest part of the meal was the marinara sauce I had to order to dip me pizza in because there was just no sauce. This place was a major disappointment.",1

However, service is also a huge part of the fine dining experience, especially when the bill for food and 2 glasses of wine costs over $330. Sadly, Everest was THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD at a fine dining establishment. In most cases, the server would set the food down, say the name of the dish, then walk away with NO explanation of the dish whatsoever! In this type of setting, I like to know what I'm eating (i.e. descriptions of each element on the plate). For the formaggi/cheese plate, the server set down the cheese without telling us what type of cheese each piece was! We also had to wait 30 minut",1

In most cases, the server would set the food down, say the name of the dish, then walk away with NO explanation of the dish whatsoever! In this type of setting, I like to know what I'm eating (i.e. descriptions of each element on the plate). For the formaggi/cheese plate, the server set down the cheese without telling us what type of cheese each piece was! We also had to wait 30 minut",1

Then he proceeded to make the order. I ended up with a beef on garlic bread with American cheese and no peppers, and fries instead of mozzarella sticks.  But by the time I got the order, there were a few other people in line, and the guy was beyond struggling now.  And the silly woman on the cell pho",2

Standards sports fare on TV (which is really boring when there's nothing but ESPN talk shows without the sound), limited beer selection (the 'non-mainstream' beers on tap are Guinness, Bass, and Blue Moon, to name a few), and notably high prices (the difference between a $4 and $5 beer is that $10 gets you two beers and two tips if the draft costs $4). For the atmosphere and selection, the prices aren't really justifiable.

"After enduring the first of three very sultry, very sweltering Lollapalooza days, my California cohorts and I were hungry to sink our teeth into some Chicago fare. As such, a few locals pointed us in the direction of Giordano's, which, according to these palate-challenged townies, is the holy grail of deep dish.   Now be advised, Chicagoans: Before you wrongly surmise that Californians have a penchant for all things bland, please take into account my former status as a Chicagoan. As a wee tike, the Dom enjoyed herself a good slice of pie of the deep dish persuasion from said eatery. Eating this flakey-crusted, cheese-infused slice of heaven was likely to induce a blissful case of  'the itis.' Sadly, my deep dish days were done after my father was relocated westward for work. And the rest i",2

"I came here for breakfast with two other people a few months ago.  The food was truly AVERAGE and way over priced.  I realize that this is Chicago, so food is not exactly cheap, but the food here is really not worth the money at all.   Also, the whole time we were there, the only thing we could smell was a strong stench of burnt toast.  At first it was not a big deal, but come on...it was very strong and it lasted our entire meal.  It became a bit nauseating and made me lose my appetite by the time our food came. One of the people I was eating with was the one that suggested the place.  She had never been there before, but she heard about it somewhere and wanted to try it out.  She was disappointed with our experience and ended up apologizing for suggesting it.",2
"In fairness, I'm a New Yorker.  I won't belabor this point, but in short, Pizzeria Uno's has better tasting crust.  The pizza that is placed in front of you is beautiful.  It is cheesy and crusty and you have great expectations, but if you like crust with taste, not like an extended cracker, you may not like this style pizza. The place was packed and came highly recommended, but I wasn't impressed.",2
"First time in Chicago and I wanted the full experience so I figured my first meal would be a deep dish pizza. I head over to Giordano's because it is just around the corner from my hotel. It was a little after 4pm and the place was pretty empty, which is fine with me since I was on my own. From the start the service was subpar. Pretty much didn't care about my presence. I went to order, and one thing I didn't like is that they didn't like is that after 3pm they no longer served individual sized deep dish pizzas. Um great so I had to order a small pizza which could have fed 3 of me. I also ordered a caesar salad since the pizza takes about half an hour to bake. The salad comes out. The dressing is very very watered down. I have never had a caesar taste like that. There really was no flavor ",2

But if you sit at the bar you really want to be sure Chris*** is not server. She has many very important text messages to deal with,  another server to chat with, schedules to go over with Mgr/ owner(?)

"Elephant & Castle has reasonably priced food, great beer, and a nice location for a quick business lunch. The food will be rated as just okay by most people, but it's decent for the price. The first two times that I went to Elephant & Castle the service was efficient, friendly, warm and above average! The third time that I ate there it took so long to get our food that we asked for a to go container with it, because my 1 hour lunch was over before any of our food arrived. The waiter apologized profusely, but that didn't fix the extensive wait. The decor is out of date, but it's not what I would classify as dingy or bad.

"Cute place, but the pizza just wasn't good. When you order it, your waiter will tell you it takes a long time to make a pizza, and you say that's fine. For the next 45 min-hour, your hunger grows while thinking of the awesome pizza you're about to stuff your face with. When they bring it out to you, the place it on the special pizza stands that all of the tables have, and serve you your first slice. My friend and I got the stuffed crust pizza with sausage.. while the sausage was really flavorful and REAL, there was just wayyy too much cheese and not enough sauce. I mean really, there was barely any sauce. It was like.... some bread, layers upon layers of cheese, and a spoonful of sauce on each slice. If you go here, avoid the stuffed crust!",2
"I think this is my first 2 star. Not for circuses but more for experience. Gioco's is a nice establishment and kind of edgy.

"I had a very disappointing experience at this Giordano's. I got there about 10 minutes before it closes and asked if they were still open.

About 10 minutes after that they served a pizza to another table, so maybe they just didn't want to wait for the pizza to bake). The waitress was also not very attentive and took about 15 minutes to bring the drinks we ordered...

Why do my vegetables look like they were sitting in a pool of their own sweat for hours? And why do my fries look like they someone just insulted their mothers and they can't do a thing about it? Poor sad dejected things. Now the taste is ok. It's not terrible. But what leaves me angry is that it could be so much better.

Well needless to say im really surprised about all the positive reviews, to begin the crust on the pizza was soo 'crackery' by that i mean pretty much it was alot like eating a thick saltine cracker it would break apart easily i think most-likely has to do with the dough they use to make it. Next the pizza itself had very little to almost no sauce and a mountain of cheese... I mean don't get me wrong i love cheese but this portion was enough to elevate ones cholesterol sky high, needless to say i really like there decor and all however i don't understand why they make there customers wait almost half an hour for some reheated pizza?

Damm this thing is thick and dense, they really pile on the toppings. However, the quality isn't there. The pie was chaaaheeeezzzy but had a generic taste. The sauce tasted like Wal-mart marinara.

"We arrived early for dinner (5:15) and had no trouble getting seated promptly. However, by 06:00 the place had practically filled up and I expect there was a long wait. Part of the reason for this is the waitress informed us the cook time for deep dish (DD) would be 35-45 minutes and since our son had never had DD before, he opted to try a peperoni and cheese DD. However, that pretty much puts anyone getting DD at 60-90 minutes minimum, so that explains the long waits and low table turnovers. It also encourages people to order the appetizers which we resisted to keep the bill down. We opted for a thin crust pizza and promptly scarfed it down as we had been walking all day. He said his DD pizza was good but I don't think he was a fan of all the cheese - DD is definitely an acquired taste. T",2

We all had a slice and it was more than one can handle. The crust was thick, the sauce was lacking flavor, and the stuffed cheese overpowered the entire pizza. I couldn't taste the crust or toppings over the cheese. And we were all very unpleased. Let me not be so harsh by saying, that it's not that bad where some may not enjoy.

Today I had the best one I've ever had probably--the Italian Night Club...   It's Italian cuts of meat on...French bread though?  well, I should say what they call French--the real French would be appalled at it though.  It actually reminds me a lot of what Subway's bread used to be.  (I do know that their bread contains no high fructose corn syrup, which is more than Subway can claim). The Vito is a more stripped down version, taking out some of the meats...  it is decent though tastes nothing like a real Italian sub. The menu encourages you to order peppers with it",2
"My first time at the Emerald Loop and the service and atmosphere was great but the food was just OK. The burger was dry and on the pretzel bread it was even worse. The best thing I had was the BBQ wings they were quite tasty. If I go back it will be for the wings and beer. The onion rings and fries were too greasy even though they had potential. I wish they were better since they are not far from my apartment...it would be a cool place to make a local watering hole.",2

"I've been here three times.  I agree with the other comments that the owner is abrasive and a bit arrogant.  The food is pretty good, not great.  My bloody mary was above average.  I would have leaned more towards 3 stars except one thing really set me off.  When my wife were here recently we were seated and before we finished ordering (literally right in the middle of us ordering) the owner pulled our waiter away and sent him to wait on (and kiss a**) to a channel 11 tv host who was quickly seated before others who had been waiting.  That is just bad form.  I don't care who you are, we were there first and if you truly are an old school Chicago deli then you (as the owner) shouldn't get a swelled head and fall all over someone who happens to be on tv. Let your atmosphere and food speak fo",2
"I stopped here as my husband wanted a quick snack for lunch as we were going out for dinner later.  He ended up getting one of the sandwiches in the little refrigerated section.  Needless to say he didn't really like it.  I ordered a chai tea, which wasn't on the menu that I could see, but the friendly man behind the counter made me one,  It wasn't good at all, though.  :(  Ah, stick to the menu, me thinks.  It was nice they had seating and a T.V. for people to watch, along with some computers.  The man behind the counter was friendly and helpful and the place seemed clean, but just not a place for us.",2
"$10 & change for a Chicken Cesar wrap + 1 small drink +chips.. The chicken wrap took a few mins to make. It was fairly big, but easy to finish.. Had it been cheaper, I would have tossed it (sad face) It had a strong tuna fish flavor that had a hidden 'Cesar-like' tangy flavor. It was not good. The way the whole thing was made was strange. Only meat in the middle? After 3 bites there's no more meat. Leaving me with plain lettuce and nasty sauce. Don't cut the wrap in the middle; just let us eat it like a burrito if that's how it's actually made. Wet sandwich, not soggy there's a difference. It stayed together but I had to keep ringing/blotting it out onto napkins and the paper it came in.... It was a wrap.... It's just too much liquid. And even now, my hands reek of tuna for some reason. :-",1

It's also very pricey for the type of food. A good option for food or drinks in between classes but that is about it. Would probably not go here if there were other options around.",2
"Unfortunately, I have to agree with not only Greg but what seems like several Eleven City Diner goers on various review websites such as Facebook and Yelp. When I first moved to the S. Loop a couple of years ago, I could easily be found at Eleven at least once a week. However, my most recent visits have confirmed that this will no longer be the case. Tonight, I made the mistake of taking my visiting cousin from Boston, immediate family, and boyfriend to Eleven for dinner with my high recommendation. While the waitress was good, the food and presentation were a HUGE disappointment. Brad, the first thing you discuss in your Check Please interview are Eleven's large portions... Where were these tonight?! There is absolutely no way a Jewish deli style deli sandwich should be small nonetheless ",2

"Can't really bring myself to come back here -- tomato sauce is an incredibly important part of a good pizza, and theirs is gross.  Given how fattening it is, it needs to really appeal to your most basal culinary desires, otherwise it fails.  This brand doesn't do it for me. I went once with my boss, to give us the opportunity to sit down and talk through some work issues.  Because I knew I wasn't that into the pizza, I decided on the spaghetti, which was overcooked and mushy.  And on top of it?  That sauce.",2
"Its an okay deli: the problem is its an absolute madhouse on the weekends.  When my folks were in town recently we wanted to pick up some deli meat and eat in... should be a perfect place for that.  Indeed the meat was good and the deli prices were in line with other delis (eating at the joint is another story); but we waited around for 20 minutes to find someone to pay.  It didn't help the host was a jerk (Me: Who can I pay?  Him: She is seating customers now, you need to wait).  I understand that it gets crowded; that's good, but seriously, there's a cash register at the door... how hard could it be to find someone to man it so I could pay $2.50 for a soda?",2

This chain of places owned and created by the same person, all kind of look the same - like the Cheesecake Factory trying to be romantic and intimate. While I enjoyed my food at Marche, this is unfortunately not the case at Gioco. I had the Pesce Bianco. A whitefish on a bed of brocollini with inedible leaves, partially cooked fava beans, and little to no flavor. After spitting some leaves out, I ate more of my whitefish, which wasn't terrible, though the poor accompaniments were not helpful. The description of the dish sounds hopeful, but the taste is failure. I was not a fan of Gioco.",2

"This was my first time visting Jersey Mike's and I can definitely say it'll be my last. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and while it was ok, I can't say it was anything to write home about. First off, the fact that Jersey Mike's doesn't offer spinach wraps is astonishing to me. I ended up getting the plain flour wrap which was gummy and kinda bland. The pieces fo chicken were small and the tomatoes were sparse. The wrap was big but when it's filled with mostly lettuce the bigger size ends up getting canceled out. I ended up throwing away most of the meal because eventually the chicken ran out. Who wants to eat just lettuce, tomato pieces and gummy flour?? Additionally, I ordered my wrap without cheese and onions. When I told the young lady taking the orders (a skinny black girl) that I only",2
"I've been eating Jersey Mike's subs since 1995 when they entered Ohio.  The subs are hands down the best subs I've ever had.  If I had to rate the place solely on food they would certainly get five stars.  The Italian sub is to die.  If you are watching calories, they also have the option of making any sub into a wrap.  The toppings are always fresh and high quality.  Get it 'Mikes Way' - you can't go wrong. As to why they get three stars.....I don't like the set up of this location, or how they handle your order.  They get very busy at lunch and literally create the sandwiches like a bat out of hell.  Your sandwich gets handled by several people throughout the assembly line process and the way they flop the sandwiches around down the line reduces my hunger. I'm sure if they were any slowe",3
"Ehhhhh. I'm starting to wonder if the city can ever actually pull off an authentic Irish bar (see: Ballydoyles in Downers Grove as your template). Most don't even try. Those ones just slap an Irish name on and hang a Guinness poster on the way to the mens' room. The rest quickly devolve into Johnny O'Tooligans Irish Drinking Emporium where the decor certainly says all the right things, but the soul is lacking. Emerald Loop is more of the latter. The decor is certainly nice, but I would see this place as more of a lunch spot instead of a happy hour or dinner spot. The place got loud surprisingly quickly. I'm not sure if that's a function of the music or the crowd, but when I was on the same side of a bar table, and still can't hear the person sitting right next to me, there's a problem. You",3

There's not much selection.  As far as burgers, you can either get the regular (comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, raw or grilled onions; fried egg, organic bacon, and choice of cheese are about $0.70 extra) or the BLT (which comes with the egg, bacon, and cheese already!) - both for $5.99.  They have 1 chicken sandwich option, 1 turkey burger option, and 1 portabello mushroom sandwich option.  That's about the entire menu.  They also offer combo meals (burg",3
"Went here for a fairly late night dinner and had tuna melt, reuben, matzo ball soup, pickles, etc.  It's about time someone opened a Jewish-style deli that isn't either 1) dirty, or 2) in Lincolnwood/Skokie. This place had a good vibe and the food was good. A nice mix between a higher-end diner and Jewish comfort food.  Sandwiches were huge, the matzo ball soup, if you are a connoisseur of such fare, was typical restaurant broth plus massive ball; this is not your bubby's soup - but i've never been to a restaurant that makes it like she can anyway. I would give this place four stars but they were out of regular Dr. Brown's Black Cherry and I had to choke down a diet. :) Regardless, definitely plan on going back and trying some of the other staples to see if it can replace a trip out to Kau",3

"Yup this is a pricey burger joint, but it was convenient to the hotel. It  has a very young vibe with Epic at the base of a Columbia College building. The interior is modern with industrial elements (exposed interior, concrete and light fixtures) mixed with R&B music playing in the background. I had the epic burger (beef) on a wheat roll with havarti horseradish, lettuce, tomato, pickles and epic sauce. I chowed down on the burger with the hand cut fries with sea salt. The burger was moist and packed full. I really liked the wheat roll as a 'healthy' alternative. I thought that there was something missing (flavor wise) from the burger. It was good but not epic. The hand cut fries with sea salt were nice but not amazing. I love the concept of customizing your burger with fresh ingredients a",3
"We went in tonight with a group of 7 after a softball game for some food and drinks. Our waitress was nice but was really dang slow with our bill. Seriously, she dropped it off and didn't come back until one of us went to find her. This was like 15 minutes or so. The food was alright. Everyone in my party got the burger special which was $4.95 burgers with fries and $1 topping. One person's order got messed up, it was 'well done' when he asked for 'medium.' It was also missing a topping. Then it came back out like 2 minutes later with the topping on there so we assume that they sent out the same 'well done' burger. This was notified to the waitress and she comped the burger. The other burgers were almost all there, cooked as ordered but still, everyone said it was kind of dry. My sister sa",3
"As clueless hungry tourists, our desperation drove us to what appeared to be a standard looking pizzeria. Hopeful, we thought it might not have even been a chain. Wrong! Nice to know, though, that we can dine in the company of our fellow tourists, it's comforting.   I did not have Chicago style pizza on my list of must-have eats while being a tourist here, but it was desperate times. We got the stuffed pizza, with pineapple and ham. To tide us over for the 35 minute preparation time, we got a caprese salad. The caprese was made with what appeared to be ginormous slabs of mozzarella, pale unripened tomatoes and a few grassy strands of basil. The mozz was good, at least, I happily ate that and hoarded the leftover plate of balsamic for dipping my hefty pizza crusts into. Pizza was okay, noth",3

Nothing on the menu thrilled me so I ordered a relatively safe dish: the southwest chicken salad, which now appears on every menu from Cheesecake Factory to McDonald's. The salad was okay, The greens were fresh, and there wasn't an abundance of dressing, which is ok by me. My only complaint is that the chicken was ice-cold, like it was sitting in the c",2

Really, really tasty burgers (have to love a place that tops their burgers with classic hot dog toppings, pickle spear included) and mediocre fries. I do enjoy the Merkt's Cheddar squeezed on, and the burgers are always pretty juicy, thanks to perpetually soaking half-cooked in a broth bath. The dogs are okay, and the beef is 'eh.'  The latter being a little flavorless and the the former being burnt to a crisp more often than not. I understand and embrace the 'char' aspect, but they go a little overboard here. The knocking aspect of Gold Coast Dogs is that they are brutally inconsistent from store to store.

Total came out to ~$12. The burger was not over-cooked and the meat was flavorful and held together well (very important for a good burger). I read that you could add a fried egg on top of the burger, and I certainly look forward to going back to try that. The chocolate shake was just to die for...perfect for a TGIF lunch.

The food always came out quickly and well prepared. My main problem with Elephant & Castle is the wait staff. I went about half a dozen times and had a different waiter/ waitress each time. You would think that at least one of them would have given us good service, sadly that did not happen. Each time our waiter/ waitress forgot something, the silverware, the drinks, our appetizer.

I would not recommend the baked mostaccioli - it is really disappointing. I prefer thin crust over the stuffed pizza since it's less of a brick in your stomach. But really, it doesn't matter what you eat here, you'll be in a food coma afterwards. Don't forget to take a mint or two on your way out. I think the service here is really hit or miss.

Several gents in the office are hooked on it - multiple visits a week. They have a good collection of sides too, mashed potatoes, corn, etc. Even cranberry sauce. So, I had the turkey platter - which was good, not out of the ordinary. It was a ton of food for not much money though - there's definite value h",3
"the only reason they get three stars is because i love jimmy john's. but this one, right across from where i work, doesn't always serve well. i notice that the workers are much more efficient when it's busy and take their time when i'm the only one there. not that i mind waiting for my sandwich, but don't they want to impress me with their sandwich making skills. and furthermore, i get a beach club faster than i get a turkey without tomatoes and mayo. that makes no sense. it's not a bad location, it just makes me wonder.",3
"Just OK.  Menu is limited but interesting, burgers are well cooked with quality meat, fries are just mediocre.. decor is interesting.  Don't know if I would return.",3
"We came to Elephant & Castle for happy hour on a Friday. A couple people went early to grab a table for our group, which ended up being a good move. The place attracts a decent after work crowd; however, it thins out by around 7. Good selection of beer here, with average prices. We tried a few appetizers, which were okay, but not great. The nachos featured too many chips and not enough topping. For $13.50, I expect a heaping amount of toppings. The guac had a LOT of lime in it. I like lime and all, but it should not be the only flavor I taste. Pretzels were nice and warm and come with a grain mustard - this was my favorite out of the ones we tried. The potato skins, which come with bacon and cheese, were nothing special. There were only like 4 skins, so we had to cut them in half so everyo",3
"Came here on a late night whim on a very, very cold Chicago night. The nachos were pretty good, drinks were strong, but I was surprised at how empty it was, I guess its more popular with the after work crowd. There's nothing new on the menu here, but its a good option and nice additon to the Loop...certainly beats the chain dining that tends to dominate.",3
"I went here for some drinks on a Wednesday night and the atmosphere was great. This is great place to hang out and drink on a weekday. As for dinner, not so sure, we ordered nachos which came out burnt. Otherwise its a great place to hang out with a group a friends.",3
"After many, many recommendations of 'best pie places in Chicago', for our last dinner meal before returning to D.C., we opted for Giordano's, because we heard it was supposed to be 'the best of the best', and also because it's practically a stone's throw away from the Hyatt. Two lessons I have taken away from that meal: Lesson One - when somebody tells you to bring your appetite to Giordano's and NOT to have any appetizers beforehand, LISTEN TO THEM. And Lesson Two? The 'best stuffed pie' debate may continue to rage on, but it's all fairly subjective.  I can't say that a bite of Giordano's generously endowed 'small' pie (and I use the word 'small' facetiously) had me shouting to the rafters for joy, but for what it is, it's a pretty damn good pie.  I just wish we hadn't had chicken fingers",3
"I was in Chicago for a conference and during a lunch break several of us went and hit up Giordano's because it was close and because it seems to have a bit of a reputation around Chicago. I was excited to have my first taste of real Chicago deep dish and expected it to easily top the imitation deep dish I had had at Sacramento's 'Chicago Fire' just a few weeks earlier. I was a bit disappointed.  The pizza was good, don't get me wrong.  I just didn't think it was that great.  In fact I liked Sacramento's imitation a bit better.  Believe it or not the ingredients at Chicago Fire seemed to be of a higher quality and there seemed to be more care put into the pizza.  Plus it was cheaper. We had the super veggie and the meat.  Both were good, but they didn't blow me away.  Giordano's was easily ",3
"Stuffed pizza. 1 slice = joy! 2 slices = still yum.  3rd slice when trying to finish off a pie w/1 buddy = pain. Honestly haven't had enough stuffed pizza to cast too much judgment, but it was good enough to me.  What I didn't appreciate so much was waiting an hour to get my pizza.  Granted, I went there during the least busy shift of the day (4p) where everyone is on their coffee/smoke breaks, but still, 1 hour after ordering? I know stuffed pizza takes longer to cook, but.... Oh well, I'm more of a thin crust guy anyway; will have to try theirs at a later date.",3
"We went here for our anniversary, and it was good, but not spectacular. The view was spectacular with 290 extending to the horizon, and we were there when it was VERY slow. There were maybe 15 diners for 3 hours. The food was good, not plentiful, but not spectacular. The service was good, very attentive, yet not stifling. I wouldn't go back because there are so many good restaurants in Chicago, why not try others?",3
"#8 Billy Club, #10 Hunter's Club and #15 Club Tuna are my favorites. JJ's is one those places that is so hard to resists and this outlet does a great job of keeping my religious craving coming back for more. why 3 stars, for one they sometime screw up my order and the delivery service is never on time.",3
"Huge fan of JJ's ever since Subway made me sick *gags* Well living in the burbs and now working downtown I have noticed all types of price differences....I mean come on 6.00 for one sandwich without any mayo or anything on it?! Are you kidding me, I mean in the West they are only 3.99 at the same chain! I swear its not JJ's that I am faulting but moreso the Loop.....Blame the LOOP for those three stars dammit",3
"3 1/2 stars. I'd previously been to Gioco for a work event and recall the food being much tastier than I experienced on our visit a few weeks ago. I had a the shrimp bucatini and the shrimp weren't deveined! C'mon now - that's just bush league! Maybe the shrimp poop detracted the flavor from the sauce, because I found the dish bland. Hubby had the mushroom ravioli, which he said he enjoyed Dessert was very good - mascarpone tart and the tiramisu. If you're into  cordials & wines, you can't go wrong with the housemade limoncello or the Bigaro Moscatto. Love the location, as well as the ambiance. It's a place you can feel comfortable hanging out all night, lingering over dinner, enjoying your company and wine...and shrimp poop. I *might* return to Gioco if they offer another Groupon; however",2
"You can't accuse me of not being open-minded! I went back to Exchequer today. OK, so it wasn't my choice...the boss was taking everyone out to lunch and he picked. And I'm not one to turn my nose up at a free lunch. But I do turn my nose up at bad pizza, so I had a sandwich instead. I tried the crunchy pulled pork sandwich, and it was actually very good! Our waitress was very nice (she called me 'honey', and not in a condescending way) and service was good. So...I'm bumping this place up to A-OK. I still don't recommend the thin crust pizza, but there is some good stuff to be had here and they have a respectable beer selection.",3
"I've been too tough on E&C. Sure, it's not going to give any new revelations on comfort food, but I'm glad that it's here, and even more glad that I work near here again. The chicken pot pie was tasty after a long day of work, but a bit of a small portion. Crust was nice and crispy, but I couldn't care less for green beans and (even) the garlic mashed potatoes that came with it. Just fill me up on pot pie! Service was really quick, and I love the 20 oz. Imperial Pint pours. The Guiness was just what the Weatherman ordered, and went perfectly with the chix pot pie. I am definitely going to make this a lunch and afterwork pop-in staple, now that I'm downtown again.",3
"I love me some Chicago.  I and was determined to fall in love with the Chicago food staple - the deepdish pizza - so trying Giordano's was a must. I really wish I could give this place more stars, but here are the reasons for docking of two stars: 1) Took forever.  We were seated promptly, but we didn't get our drinks for the longest time.  Deepdish pizza naturally takes a long time to make, but the wait was almost unbearable considering we were starving.  Good thing we ordered some fries to tie us down during the 45 minute wait. 2) We settled for this place instead of Gino's East.  We were a bit a way from that place and was too lazy and too hungry to go there.  Perhaps we should have.  The thought 'maybe Gino's is better' lingering in the back of your mind keeps your from fully enjoying ",3
"We really enjoyed the deep dish pizza.  The services was - eh.  We went on Sunday evening and a few of the waitresses and a bus boy were dressed up for halloween.  We are not fans of halloween, but to each his own.  I felt kind of bad for one of the waitresses because she was dressed up as Madonna or a bride or a mix of both and the table she was helping laughed at her constantly.  Jerks.  I mean - like I said - we don't do halloween, but we didn't make fun of anyone either. Our waitress (was not dressed up) had a habit of disappearing, not refilling our drinks and putting forth as minimal of an effort as possible.  Typically, we order from Giordano's in Hyde Park and always delivery.  So this could have been an off night for this location.  I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and a sho",3
"I guess this is one of the new Gino's East sports bar where instead of a family feel it's more of an adult atmosphere.  The real reason why my buddy and I met here is because we wanted a cheap meal and found a Group On that we could use the day of.  So, 3 hours later there we were at Gino's sports bar. The Group On limited us to one beer a piece and a medium sized pizza.  I was particularly curious to try the Flossmoor Station brew that was listed on the Group On HOWEVER - this Gino's East didn't carry it!  False marketing.  I will have to alert Group On.  And oddly enough, this is the third place in the city that has a Flossmoor Station beer listed on their menu and hasn't been able to produce it for me in a glass or any other form.  Once I was told it was 'lost.' We ordered basil and spi",3
"Service here is not that friendly.  My order was screwed up and they didn't bother apologizing.  It seemed more like a order and promptly pay ordeal.  'Move to the side' was quickly uttered as I finished ordering.  Consistent in quality, but definitely odd in terms of a reputable company.",1
"How genius is it that a bar sets up a game of bags INSIDE the bar?!  I think it's pretty genius. I'm reticent to tell you all this because when I go there on Fridays, I want to play, and there's only space for one set.  But, I'm feeling bighearted today, so I'll share.   My buddy and I went for lunch and split the nachos and chicken fingers. Nachos were the 'special' at half-price, only $4. It was a huge order, but also looks better from a distance. Toppings were very skim, probably because it was the 'special'. So... NOT special. I like their chicken fingers quite a bit.  Other food is decent, don't expect too much, and it's best to stick to simple things. It's a bar. I'd say it's a pretty legit lunch if I can play bags, watch the PGA Championship while also watching some ribbon gymnastic",3
"Well, what do you know?  The second meal here would be deep dish once again!  Can't get enough of it, I guess? This place has quite a different feel from Gino's.  It was more brightly lit and there was no graffiti.  There was plenty of seating, so we were at our table right away. I think I was more hungry, so I felt prepared to finish the pizza this time around.  We ordered a small instead because we learned our lesson the night before.  Sausage topping again.  Don't know why.  I guess we wanted to try crumbled.  We also ordered garlic bread to help with the wait.  The bread was not bad, the sauce was okay.  It wasn't as good as Gino's sauce.  The pizza actually came a little quicker this time.  The pizza was slightly different from Gino's.  I think it's more cheesy, which I wouldn't consi",3
"Pros: Fast service, friendly staff, fresher than subway, cheap delivery, quite a few choices and good chips. Cons: No pickles to put on your sub and you have to buy a ginormous pickle (don't forget to ask them to slice it, or you will be in quite a situation), no wheat buns, not the best quality lunch meat, nothing toasted, not open late enough at this location for those of us that work late or have night classes.  AND they don't have yellow mustard!  What is this, New York?  Please. A-OK is a perfect description of this place.",3
"Great supposed fast food burgers that are pricey. We had the combo with milk shakes, and it was almost $25 for the both of us. The burgers were juicy and beef and they served everything on biodegradable materials, and applaud them for that.",3
"Love this place.  First time I had ever heard of Smithwicks, so naturally I tried it with my shepherds pie.  Just excellent.  Portions were large, atmosphere was sort of like being in Alan Quartermain's sports club, old style with heavy dark wood, and brass highlights.  Good choice for taking visitors and friends for a drink.",3
"Went here with my son for lunch.  Service was pretty quick.  Food was just ok.  I was a little disgusted that I'm eating dowtown at a restaurant with a torn tablecloth dusty window shades.  Check out my pics.",3
"Went there last night. My overall review was that it was ok. Nothing epic about it. I don't like fresh cut fries style. The burger was more bun than burger. I typically do this everywhere I go but I dig out a majority of the bun off my burgers and sandwiches and after I did that, it looked really not much different than a McD's burger. I got Horseradish Havarti cheese on it and could barely taste it, along with barely tasting their epic sauce, which I'm glad the gf ordered it on the side because I was able to add more to my burger. That being said, if I was in the area (and I am quite often at the Library across the street), and I wanted a burger, I'd consider going back. The atmosphere was different of most places and quite honestly I like that kind of atmosphere. The place did look sorta",2
"I like Gioco.  For a long time, it was one of the few nice restaurants in the neighborhood, but others have opened, and now, there's a nice mix of restaurants around now.  Gioco has dependable Italian cuisine, and good wines to compliment the food.  The atmosphere is nice and the wait staff is friendly.",3

"Hour wait to get in and it was.... well, sort of worth it. I tend to think this place is a bit overrated, and their are other pizza shops with better pies. I was born in Chicago and grew up eating pizza in the Chi. The pie is deep dish and overloaded with cheese in the middle, tomato sauce, and minimal toppings (bummer) on the top of the stuffed pie. Customer service was not good at all. Not once did the waiter checkup on us once the pizza was out. I was without beverage for the 2nd half of my meal... I like to consider Giordanos as a parallel to Jim's Steaks in Philly. You go to Giordanos if you don't know anything about Chicago-style pizza and you are a visiting tourist. But this is a good place for people to get acquainted with deep dish pies (UNOs doesn't count!) in the Windy City.",3

So here you are looking at my review waiting to see what the hell I'm going to say. You want the truth. Well YOU CANT HANDLE THE TRUTH! (Sorry, been looking for a way to work that into one of my reviews for a while.) So Grace O'Malleys is your more upscale Irish pub where folks go to have a little dranky drank drank or grab some grub.  I didnt like the either/or rule that day, so I did both. Sue me. When you walk into Grace O'Malley's there are probably about 30 high stools where you can sit (probably half at the bar, the other half at tables that seat 4).  My luck being what it usually is, all the seats were taken on this",3

"It's food. They have everything on the menu you can imagine; pasta, burgers, pizza, steak and even ribs.

"Why do I continue to go to this place...Well because the same friend I have gone with two other times really loves this place. It was her bday so I didn't want to put up much of a fuss but the food is just alright. Its nothing to rave about however the chicken sausage is very tasty hence why I didnt change the star rating. I see the owner has not changed he still walks around being rude to his workers and guest. Just not impressed.",3
"Ever since I saw a commercial for a cheeseburger while on the elliptical a week ago (yes, it was torture) I could not stop craving one. Saturday night came along and I didn't want to cook or go out anywhere that required me to look cute.  Epic Burger had been on my list of places to try for awhile, so it fit perfectly into the equation.   This place was a splurge, but I enjoyed each not-so-good-for-me bite. I got the Epic Burger with cheddar, lettuce, and tomato with fries.  The burger was large, juicy, greasy, and delicious (however it was a bit too peppery for my ideal).  The fries reminded me of the ones from Great Steak & Potato Co (I mean that as a compliment) with the skins on, a little crispy but mostly soft, and all stuck together.  I also had a few sips (or half of) my boyfriend's",3
"I know this is a must-do in Chicago but it didn't live up to the hype as far as I'm concerned. Maybe I just like my back home NY style pizza but I do think I can insist that anyone should stop by here for Chicago style pizza if they're in the area. I didn't like the crust - it was hard and had the texture of an apple pie crust instead of a crispy pizza crust. I thought the sauce lacked some taste but approve of the exaggerated stuffed toppings - sausage and pep flying over the place over melted cheese, nice.",3

I'm almost 6ft tall with red flipping hair...How can you forget about me so much!?   You make me mad, but I love berry fulfilling...so keep them coming :)",3
"This is our neighborhood bar, what more can I say?  Very friendly staff and bartenders.  Food is Irish style and regular pub favorites.  Great place to go for a beer and appetizers.  Great salads as well.  I have never sat in the back for a proper meal.  The bar area is very inviting and a great place to relax.",4
"This is the weirdest looking place. A hot, smelly hut on the side of the road, but the food is very good at a normal price. I kept it simple for my first time around and went with sweet and sour pork. They cooked it not 5 feet away from me in about 10 minutes. Most Chinese places mass produce the food and leave it sitting out all day, so I appreciated the fresh grub. The portions were generous as expected. I thought I would never go to this place and now I find myself coming back.",4
"I have never been in the restaurant, only had delivery...it was mighty good. It is one of the few places that I know of that does fresh spinach on their pizzas and all their ingredient taste really fresh and they do not skimp on the sausage, pepperoni, etc.  I have only had thin crust and I really really like it.   The delivery is also super fast. I can't wait to dine in and try out their stuffed pizza.",4
"The food here is great. After coming back from a vacation in Italy, we were in search of Italian food that would be, well, Italian. This place has come the closest to serving authentic italian food. The atmosphere is wonderful inside and outside. I rented one of the private rooms for a party and all of my guests were amazed by the decor. The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is because we were sweltering hot in the private room. We asked to get the air turned down a little bit but for some reason it never cooled down. It was very hot outside that day but it would have been nice to have it cooler inside. I still recommend going here and will go back myself.",4

"This was the second stop on our impromptu pub crawl in the city on St. Patrick's Day.  It was a LOT of fun!!   It took a while for the boys to belly up to the bar to order the drinks, but that's to be expected.  It was busy and hopping, but not douchey or Jersey Shore.  It was a nice mix of adults having a great time.  We were also able to find a table near the back to sit.  It was nice because we could still hear the music, but we were able to drink/talk at the same time.  Always a bonus when you're with good company! The music was DJ style and it was a good mix.  Some Mumford and Sons, some Beatles, with a dash of Kelly Clarkson thrown in there.  Something for everyone! The bathrooms are really clean, too.  A definite plus in the city, because that's not always the case! I perused a menu",4
"There are two parts to Epic Burger. 1. The amazingly delicious Burger.  It was really one of the best I've had in a long time.  It was fresh, it was juicy, and it was quick.  I got the burger with an egg on it, and that was a very good choice.  The special sauce was also good, and the bun topped off the deliciousness. 2. The kind of really disappointing fries. They were really hot when we got them, and then they quickly cooled off into a soggy mess.  The taste was something to be desired as well.  We got two orders, but when the fries arrived, we could have easily shared one order. It was really cool to have cups that were biodegradable, and the staff was nice, even though I had no idea what to order for the first 5 minutes.   The Staff and the burger outweigh the fries.   Probably will go",4
"I was visiting a friend who lives in Chicago and we, with our other friends, went to Giordano's for an early dinner. My stomach can't handle heavy food, but theirs could so I was lame and ordered garlic bread and a Greek salad while the rest of them ordered a deep dish cheese pizza. When our food arrived, the waitress put the salad in the middle of table, assuming that we were going to be eating it before the pizza, but alas, I told her, in a defeated voice, that it was my meal and she looked surprised. I guess people don't exactly go there for salads. The Greek salad was....a Greek salad. It came with anchovies, which I love and was decent. The garlic bread came with marinara sauce and was not all that garlicky.  As soon as my friends got their pizza, they dove in. I bravely tried a small",4
"really good food. loved their pizza",4
"let's start off this way. i am just evaluating this pizza against other chicago style pizza places. that means you have to love motz cheese. in case you don't know a chitown pizza, the style is basically toppings solidified within a ton of cheese, contained in a crust bowl. the cheese is everywhere. so, what's left to evaluate: cheese and topping. let me jump to the conclusions -- you can't beat giordano's crust. it's butter and delicious. if you you're a sausage man, you should hit up gino's. if not, then this is your place.",4
"My friend and I ordered calamari for starters then a10-inch pepperoni and sausage-stuffed deep dish cheese pizza at this spot. Both were presented in generous portions! The calamari was delectably crispy while the deep dish had extremely tasty and thick mozzarella. At first, a ten-inch diameter for a pizza seems just enough for two .. but with this chicago deep dish, it is definitely more than enough! There is a 30-min wait for the pizza to be served but with food this good, it is well worth the wait!",4
"When you walk in your nose is bombarded with 3 different things. Dunkin Donuts coffee, Bacci's Pizza, and the tantalizing whiff of fresh made bagels. All of these things are cloistered in a small basement like space but luckily you can follow your nose to Jaffa. I've gone here a couple of times and the first thing I can say is that the people working are really nice. They listen to what you are saying and tailor your bagel or food to how you like it which is nice. They even let me pay in change (hey I'm poor what do you want). I've had the Mediterranean food and the bagels and my favorite is the warm soft bagels. Toasted they are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and with a good helping of cream cheese and veggies (I like tomato and onion mmm) it's one of the better places to gra",5
"Never having had Chicago style deep dish pizza before, I was very intrigued and surprised trying it for the first time. I always thought deep dish pizza just meant thicker crust and more dough. But it turns out Chicago deep dish pizza isn't 'deep' in a sense that the dough is thicker, but more so it's deep like a pie. In fact, the crust is actually quite thin! It's the many layers of toppings and cheese that makes it thick. My friends and I ordered the 'Large Special Deep Dish Pizza ($26.75) - Sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions'. It took 40 mins to prepare and cook, and we were tempted to order other things on the menu like salad and pasta while we waited. But we persevered, and when it finally came, it was worth it! The large pizza is cut into 8 slices that are seemingly manageable",4
"While I'm not usually a fan of deep dish pizza, Giordano's was as good as I've heard about. Can't wait for my next trip to Chicago to try another variety!",4
"good location & great burgers: We stopped here for lunch and really enjoyed it here. My girl enjoyed her sandwich and it came hot & fresh. I ordered the St.Louis burger and it was out of this world. If you want a good burger that's the one to order,real good think sliced bacon plus cheese. We got the cheese fries too and they were great. This a little diner and we enjoyed it a lot.You can also eat your lunch and do some people watching off the streets.It was priced a little higher than other burger joints but it is something worthwhile to visit.",4

"Yummy time here after being on a train from California for 2 days. They let me order a personal size pizza even though it was dinner and that size pizza is offered only for lunch. thank you so much. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Had a nice conversation at the bar with some military bro. He said he was trying to drink more beer so he could bro out with his bros. His drink of choice is normally vodka/cran... teehee. However, I feel every bar should have at least one West Coast Microbrew available and Giordano's didn't have. East Coast beer just isn't as good.",5
"Giordano's.  Pizza.  Stuffed.  Me.  Stuffed.  Pure satisfaction. So, I went here on a convention once and boy was I pleased.  You cannot get stuffed pizza this good anywhere on the west coast.  So we're all kind of buzzed from the nice cool pitcher(s) of beer that we managed to polish off while they were baking our 14' large stuffed pie, and we have some friends from Southern California there, and they are absolutely starving, and we sort of forgot to tell them that they give you forks and knives for a reason.  Hot pizza sauce, short pants, good times.",4
"I'd give this place 5 stars but some of their tables are insanely close together and makes things a little uncomfortable sometimes, so 4 stars it is. But Gioco is a great place. If you've walked by Gioco at night, then you know when you look inside that everyone's having a great time. I get a little jealous myself walking by when I have no one to go there with. I feel your pain. But once you're inside, it's awesome. Everybody loves Italian food and you won't find any surprises on the menu, but everything is prepared very well. I've always been a sucker for caprese salads, but the arugula and pear salad is where it's at. On the pasta side, you can never go wrong with the gnocchi. And for an entree, I'm always going with the veal. They pound that veal down and serve it up with prosciutto and",4
"I debated between 4 and 5 stars, but ultimately settled on 4 because I don't have much to compare my deep dish to.  The last time I had Chicago deep dish was about 10+ years ago.  Anyway.... We showed up a little after 6 on a Sunday evening Labor Day weekend.  Busy.  45 minute wait for 2 people.  But we spied 2 spots at the bar and took those instead of waiting for a table.  Best decision ever. The bartender was AMAZING.  He was so fun to watch, quick to respond to drink requests and so accommodating to the table drink orders as well as those of people waiting for tables.  He was one of the highlights of the meal, seriously. The pizza was delicious.  We got the SMALL special stuffed, it was MORE than enough for my boyfriend and I, and we took home 2 slices for leftovers.  As I continue to ",4
"Everyone has their preference of deep dish pizza.  I personally liked Gino's better but just slightly.  Both are very very good places to get a pie.  Just a heads up, I ordered pineapple and instead of baking it inside, it was put on top.  I was a little disappointed about that.",4
"So, I will be honest. I've seen this lilac-colored truck outside my office several times over the past few weeks . . . and every time I've felt the urge to try it, I've gone on Yelp, realized it's nowhere to be found, and changed my mind. I guess I figured that, if Gigi's was really legit and good, it would be on here already. Today, though, I absolutely needed something sweet and I didn't care that this lone truck had no previous Yelp reviews. I wanted cupcakes and I couldn't deny the fact that there were plenty to be had just a few steps from my building. I bought the pumpkin latte, the toasted coconut, and the carrot for $3.50 a pop which is a considerable amount of money just for dessert, but I figured it would be worth it if I shared with my coworkers. The cupcakes come in really nice",4
"Just ordered lunch for a big office meeting today and got a variety of wraps, salad and a small desert tray for 30+ people.  Needless to say, everyone LOVED the wraps and were going crazy over the guacamole.  Personally, I had a wrap that was filled with yummy taboulis goodness (don't even see that one on the menu, but it was amazing!), lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, turkey and large creamy slices of avocado. Although I was't thrilled with my experience in ordering the lunch through the catering staff over the phone, the delicious food that arrived in large portions made up for it. I will definitely order from them again!",4

They have tons of bagels and cream cheeses to choose from, my favorite is a toasted onion or garlic bagel with chive cream cheese. I just went here to get lunch the other day for the first time and got a half dark half white meat turkey sandwich on a french roll with 'the works'. It's real turkey too, that giant carcass just lies in front of ya waiting for you to devour it. They also have tons of juices and smoothies, but I find that it takes long compared to how fast they get food out. $4+ to use plastic. There is some seating, but it seems cramped in there, but I usually just bring it back to my office - and make sure my co workers catch a whiff of that t",4
"A wonderful romantic setting overlooking the city. Began with lovely cocktails for the Valentine's menu.  Extremely reasonable prices considering the quality and caliber of the restaurant.  The staff were incredibly attentive and welcoming.  We'll definitely return on another special occasion.",5
"No frills just great pizza.  Not a huge fan of stuffed so I usually get the thin crust.  Its good and I would recommend it to anyone.",4
"I am addicted to their mini cheeseburgers and mini buffalo chicken sandwiches. Yummm !!  The bread has a little bit of a sweetness which goes so well with the rich angus beef.  As for their regular burger, I feel like the pretzel bread overpowers the beef, so I stick with my min burgers.  Its a great place to hang out at the bar, have a drink, and munch on the mini-sandwiches. I also like to do take out on the minis.  Its great finger food when having people over.",4
"My friend and I arrived in Chicago on 6/23 and were looking to grab a relatively quick late dinner around 9:00. We walked from our hotel and happened upon this new Gino's East location on our way to a different restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised to be able to get a table right away with no wait. The atmosphere was really nice and our waitress was really friendly. We appreciated the variety of craft beers available. I have enjoyed the chicago style pizza at other Gino's East locations during previous visits to the city and this one was no exception. We had the deep dish margherita pizza which I really enjoyed.",4

"Worth getting a reservation and baby sitter. We have had the pleasure of dining here on three separate occasions. All of our visits have been dinners and I personally can attest to the fact that their seasonal specials  are worth a shot. Pricey, but you get what you pay for here. Wine selection was perfect thanks to the suggestion from our server. We will return.",4
"i went here as a prelude to the aquarium on a late sunday morning and fell in love with the place from the moment i walked in.  everything on the menu sounded amazing.  my friends split the monte cristo which was so good and i had the tom waits breakfast.  it felt like at any moment woody allen might walk in and share a rueben with me.  the milkshakes were delicious, my dish enormous, and the waitress perfectly bitchy.  the only downside are the prices.",4
"Once in awhile, I take my 7star schanookie to lunch, and let me tell you, baby, I spare EVERY expense in these economic times! There's something about these greasy little joints. If you get them, you get them -  a siren call no urban sailor can resist. If you don't, no amount of cajoling will get you thru the door. Thankfully - as unashamed as an adult who has not lost their taste for Tang (me) - that is the adoration I unabashedly hold for these boites. Serendipitously, my companion was a good get to go to Gina's on this incredibly rainy day. Plus, it was across the street from where we were. The food. It's a patient man who will allow me my 15 minute menu perusal, culminating in my usual BLT order (the 6 year old palate who still likes Tang) and still be amused by a rare predictable side",4
"Item: the pizza was excellent. Item: the pasta was reasonably good. Item: the Diet Coke had a subtle evergreen bouquet. Item: the appetizer took approximately 47 years to arrive. Item: my side salad came not with the appetizer, but with my dining companion's personal pizza. Item: my pasta came after the pizza, creating an awkward lag time post-pizza/mid-pasta consumption. Item: my dining companion and I accumulated nine plates by the end of our meal, as the waiter inexplicably brought four dinner-sized plates upon which to eat the appetizers. Item: we spent 1.5 hours in the restaurant *after sitting down*. Item: our lengthy stay at Giordano's resulted in a series of events that culminated in a heroic dash for a train that pulled away literally seconds after we boarded. Conclusion: good foo",4
"WOW... Hidden, but such a treat!  Really liked the food here.   Friendly people around you, good decor... .and yummy sandwiches.  Go for the BBQ chicken sandwich or the salads... (all I've had there).  Very very good.   Considering we went there during lunch, it was a long wait to get seated, but worth it. The staff is prompt, and the place is very clean.   Highly recommend this place for weekday lunch",4

"Stopped into Eleven City Diner with my crew of South Side veterans and regulars, and the owner picked up conversation with our regulars right where they last left off. Since we were there for dinner it wasn't hard to get a table. The atmosphere and two-story ceiling is festive and jovial. I ordered the Eleven City French Toast, challah with strawberries, bananas, and toasted coconut; and it did not disappoint! Too late for a Lavazza coffee, I ordered a Vernor's Ginger Ale and was in sugary heaven! Eleven City features Faygo, Vernor's, and Boston Coolers, which made our Michigan representative very happy. Service was excellent. I'm still thinking of when I'll be back for that Matzo Ball Soup, and my friend Bubbie can't wait to go back and get herself a Reuben, Lox, or the Big Salad. I may o",4

They have GREAT RIBS, that are really meaty with a mild BBq sauce.  good slaw,  good rolls but the fries were so so by the time I got em home.  I want to come back with friends and try the pizza, and more ribs. Top 3 in the city for ribs.",4
"I was craving pizza last night after the museum so decided on Giordano's. There was a line out the door...I forgot it was Friday night. We decided to wait the 40 minutes and pre-ordered our pizza. They give you a cute pager to page you when your table is ready. We ordered a thin crust, half veggie half pepperoni. As soon as we sat down we were served water and asked if wanted anything else to drink. 6 minutes later our pizza arrived. Very good, very good indeed. There was a good amount of veggies on my half and they were fresh. Definately my favorite place for pizza. Worth the wait. While you wait for you table take a stroll outside and admire the fountain. LOL.",4
"The famous deep-dish, stuffed pizza of Chicago was one of the first things I had as soon as I got to the city. And I was impressed. It lived up to its reputation as a fine, filling, and delicious dish. The best thing I felt then, actually, was the fact that it wasn't very expensive either. Overall the meal was delectable. Being a tourist attraction, I expected a lot of people. However, there were a LOT of people. My friends and I were waited for about two hours before our beeper sounded, and this was a Thursday night (granted in July). The service, however, was really good for the amount of people there. My refills (I drink a lot, and I drink quickly) were frequent, and our pizza didn't take too long to come out. Overall, it was totally Chicago, and totally great. The only reason five star",4
"Great deep dish pizza! We ordered a large for all of us, and only one of our party (there were four) at more than two pieces. TVs in the restaurant give you entertainment while you wait for your pizza.",4
"Made a reservation for 2 people on http://opentable.com on a Friday morning.  Went to dinner that night. No wait. Prompt service. Quick drinks. I ordered a turkey burger and salad that were fantastic.  The boy ordered a steak sandwich and said it was the best bar food he's had in a while.   **The bar looked like a mess though with swarms of people around.  I do think it is temporary though since there is such a lack of bars in this part of downtown.",4
"I really don't like popcorn much, except when I'm at a movie, and if, on rare occasion, I pick some up from Garrett's.  I always get the cheddar/caramel mix, the smallest you can get (I think a 'medium', cuz they don't do the mix in 'small') and it's plenty for one or even two people.  It's delicious, and likely mega-fattening, you don't want to eat this stuff every day.  The only downsides, other than that, are that it is a little pricey for popcorn, and the lines, at certain times, can be ridiculous (I waited an hour in line, seriously, for a tin of this stuff around Christmas--makes a great gift, but still).  If you do buy a tin as a gift, be assured that because of the turnover, it will at least be fresh, unlike some other popcorn-tin things at Walgreen's or a grocery store.",5
"What is there new to say about a Jimmy Johns? Basically they've reached their upper limit, so the only reason to say anything bad about JJs is if there's something sub par compared to every other JJs in the world. There's nothing sup par for this one. I am amazed at how fast these guys can throw together a sandwich, though, but that's there job right? So I guess it's nothing that impressive. There's an older lady that works here which is incredibly un-JJs like to me. So that's cool to see if you come here! Only one set of doors to the outside can make it cold when it's cold, if you're eating-in. That's pretty much it. It's Jimmy John's. You get what they advertise and this place follows through.",4
"In Chicago for business, this pub was located a block down from the hotel and we were thristy for some beers...the name sounded cool, so we stopped in.  I love the selection of British taps...Fullers is well represented, as well as Smithwicks, Guinness and Strongbow (mix the two for a Black Velvet...they pour a mean one here).  Additionally they serve a few domestics like the local 312 from Goose Island Brewery, and Bell's Oberon (yum). The pub fries were great with a side of mayo, not overly greasy and cooked to perfection.  We also had a large plate of nachos that complemented our beers nicely. The service was excellent, and the bartenders play their own mixes over the speakers...Belle and Sebastian was playing loudly, which was a nice change from the usual bar music. There are a few loc",4
"Once I got past the snickering when I first heard the name, I ended up really liking this place.  It's a good bar and grill with a nice vibe to it.  I went here once to hear a live band on Saturday night.  It does get packed during some peak hours.  I recommend the fish and chips.",4
"Giordano's isn't exactly deep dish but it is my favorite non-thin crust pizza in Chicago.  Unlike Uno's, all Giordano's pizzas taste the same no matter which location you go to.  So nice to know it is always going to taste good! The problem with the pizza is that I can never have more than 2 pieces.  But lucky me that I always have leftovers the next day.",4
"Great Italian steak joint. The place is narrow but dinning rooms go far back so it looks tight when you walk in but there's room. Atmosphere for dinner is cozy and dark. I would recommend asking for a table away from exposed kitchen because it tends to get noisy and a bit warm from the grill but if you re like me and enjoy watching how it all works then its no problem. They have the best Pappardelle al Ragu Di Cinghiale, which is wide ribbon pasta with a wild boar sauce and pine nuts. Don't let the word boar scare you, this dish is great. The pasta is fresh and handmade and the sauce is not overbearing but it maybe a bit salty if you don't care for salt. Last time I went with some people that never have been there before and they all had great meals and good things to say. Also try the Cro",4
"I had lunch here with my wife this weekend. The food is usual pub fare, but they did it very well. The buffalo chicken salad my wife had was very spicy, which is good, and I liked the reuben, which had more meat than usual and less sauerkraut. The fries are excellent, cut slightly thinner (though not toothpick) and crisper than most and heavy on the seasoning, which makes for some great fries. The service was quick, the dark wood look of the place was nice, and the music was surprisingly contemporary considering the overall feel of the place.",4

"Wow I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place until today - I worked across the street from it for 6 months!! Now that our office has moved, I went back here for dinner last week for the lack of other options, and was reminded once again how much I enjoy this place! It's highly vegetarian-friendly for being a British pub, with amazzzzzzing Veggie burger, really good appetizers like Bruschetta, Potato Croquettes and Spring Rolls. Just a quick warning - most of their soups have Chicken broth and their 'Indian vegetables' have Chicken broth too. But most of their servers actually know what's vegetarian and what's not - not like the other restaurants where they don't know what being vegetarian means. I also really miss their Strawberry Salad they had this summer and it's not co",4

"Exchequer is pretty darn good.  The pepperoni pizza is my favorite!  The pepperoni must have been sent from the angel of cured meat; it's just the way that pepperoni was meant to taste. Just divey enough to fit in with the area, but not so divey that you're scared to order food.    Plus, the staff is fantastic.  I definitely recommend giving it a try. Oh and it's a great location for events. I hosted an event for about 30 people there, and it was a perfect space for socializing.",4
"Visited Chicago for Independence Day weekend. Wanted to try Chicago style pizza. I tried Giordano's since it was very close to my hotel (Hyatt). The wait was.... LONG! 30 min wait to be seated. Once we were seated, the waiter asked if we had 'Pre-ordered', I wasn't aware that this was an option... I asked the hostess 3 times how much longer to be seated and she never mentioned anything about Pre-ordering... I now know better.. After we placed our order it was another 50 mins before the pizza made it to the table... Im deducting a star for the incredibly long wait. Now for the good, the pizza was AWESOME, FABULOUS, DELISH!! We all LOVED it!! We ordered Sausage,pepperoni,mushroom pizza. As this was our first Chicago style pizza we had no idea what size to get... we went w/ a large for 3 peop",4
"I was inspired to host a Monday-night Bears game party in late December 2010, but not at my home. I walk a lot, so I may randomly dip into anything that looks  'new to me'. I spotted Jimmy Green's on south State St., took a 5-second look around, liked what I saw, and snatched a menu. I read the menu on the L and was impressed with the food options. It seemed like some effort was being made to provide interesting food for reasonable prices (as in a near-downtown value). So, it was the first place that came to mind for the party. After some e-mailing, a reservation was made. I got there a couple of hours early and Jeff was very accommodating to change the seating plan to fit my needs. I had asked for a booth, but there wasn't one large enough to allow my entire party to see the main screen e",4
"Was visiting a friend in Chicago and she insisted we had to go to Giordano's. I love deep dish so I was all for it. We called ahead and said we'd pick up because it's usually crazy busy. We arrived about 20 minutes later and the place was packed! People waiting in line, people at the bar, people waiting to be seated. This place must be great. It took about 15 extra minutes (only complaint) but we finally got our extra large, deep dish, cheese with green peppers pizza. It smelt and tasted absolutely decadent. Everything fit together perfectly and I'd go back there in a heart beat. If they don't serve this is Heaven, I'm not going.",4

"Wow. That is all I can say. My friends from out-of-town and I spent an evening dining at Gioco and we were all blown away. We started out with fried calamari and prosciutto appetizers and they were amazing. The sauces with the fried calamari were sensational. Around the horn, my date had pasta (I don't recall which one, but I know it was the one that was made with speck) and it was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I had the pork tenderloin scallopini and it was also great-- fantastic potato salad-esque side dish. The dish of the night was ordered by my friend's fiancee-- she had the veal entree and after trying one bite I was kicking myself for not ordering that as well. Damn it. Finally, my friend had the dual beef filets, which were also delicious, though he was not as big a",4
"It had probably been 10 years since I'd stepped foot in here.  Nothing has changed. We did go for lunch on a Saturday right after they opened so it was pretty empty but we were downtown for a few things and since we had our 2 year old with us and he loves trains, well, this sits right under the El. The menu has everything you'd want and although everyone raves about the pizza which is pretty good, I'd say it's the build your own burgers that rock.  You can choose from the 9 oz., 12 oz., or 16 oz. burger and add in various toppings. MK & Aidan had some sausage pizza, Romy had the Old Hickory burger and I had the 12 oz. with pepper jack and bacon with the seasoned waffle fries on a pretzel bun. We did start off with some appetizers and got a sampler plate.  Wings and Mozz Sticks were alright",4
"What a great lunch place.  Prices are a bit high but at least the food was good.  Brisket sandwich was yummy but the coleslaw was a bit soggy.  Vanilla fountain coke was good.  Burger with crunchy onions was delish. However, we were not crazy about the red velvet cake; it was a bit dry and lacked flavor. It was a fun place to go for a change of pace and scenery in the south loop area.  Will go back to sample more food and for drinks!",4

"It's a little misleading to say I'm a fan, but I do default to eating lunch here quite a bit given that I work in this building. Their bagels aren't bad but I actually quite like their fruit cup, which is quite fresh and reasonably priced too. They have freshly-squeezed OJ, which I crave sometimes. But I recommend against their smoothies. The staff here is a little, umm, odd.. Quick Tip: They do not accept AmEx and Visa/MC is only accepted above $4.",4

Her Boyfriend couldn't go so she asked me to go. we tried Giordano's. OMG I know what i am missing out on now. all cheesy and stuff. took forever but well worth it. beginning of the summer i went to Chicago and could not find anyplace the the suburbs that sold the pizza. maybe next time",5
"It's like a diner transported out of NYC to the Windy City! I went here three times over the weekend while I was at a conference taking place in the Hilton just a few blocks away. The special challah french toast is AMAZING! Seriously, challah was made for french toast (and, I guess, Jewish meals)...it was sturdy, perfectly crisped, wonderfully dressed with fresh strawberries, bananas, and kissed with a crunch from toasted coconut. I got to try a bunch of their omelettes as well, which were delicious - the spincach, feta, tomato was a favorite as was the lox omelette. I also had the corned beef hash w/ eggs and special hot ketchup...it was pretty good, though I think that pastrami they used tasted a little bit funkier than usual. Sadly, I never got the chance to try their matzoh ball soup ",4

While I was waiting I had some local beers on tap and they were excellent.  My bartender Marcee was the best.  She kept me company and my glass full the entire time i was there...which ended up being around 3 hours. Hey what can I say, once the drinks start flowing right...lol.   When you go to Chicago, you should definitely give this a shoot, you won't be disappointed.",4
"Ok, first off my burger loving ass whimped out and ordered the junior burger.  I don't know what made me doubt my powers - but I definitely could've handled the regular.  Anyways, I dug the fact that I had a real good burger for lunch, but one that had fresh ingredients and an eco-friendly twist to it.  You know, so I can tell myself I'm actually doing my body good by eating a big ass burger for lunch every single day.  Better yet, I dug how the girl taking my order answered every single moronic newbie question I had, and I basically ended up with a made to order burger delivered to my table in about five minutes.  Oh, and ample lunchtime seating and having the IFC on didn't hurt either.  Although I doubt I'm gonna really want to seriously rock a $10 lunch everyday, I definitely will throw",4

However, even though we ordered it to go, we still had to wait 50 minutes for our pizza to be done! Onto the pizza! As a Californian, a real stuffed pizza was a new experience. There's just so much with a thick layer of cheese and a layer of sauce that's just enough and not overpowering. It's a solid pizza.",4
"Yummy!  I got the Santa Rosa wrap with the free chips, salsa and guacamole.  The wrap was awesome.  I'm usually not a fan of flour tortillas because they usually have a weird after taste.  The tortilla at Goodwin's tasted awesome because it was pretty thin and seemingly fresh...maybe even home made.  The spicy beans were good, the guac was good, everything was good :-)  There are so many options!  I'll have to go back more often because the sandwiches look pretty taste, too.  All the comments about the line  length are true, call in your order or make it a late lunch (after 1 pm).",4
"This place is a chain, the largest deep-dish pizza chain in Chicago, and you know what? It's pretty damn good. We got free bread, which was great, ordered a big salad (pizza takes a long time), and that was really good (we finished a huge bowl between two of us), and the pizza, their signature offering, is top-of-the-line deep dish, what they've been doing for years and years. So while it's the McDonald's of deep dish in Chicago in some ways, it's still really good stuff, probably where I'd take out-of-towners for deep dish if they came to Chicago and asked for it.",4
"Some of these reviews are making me laugh, because it's making me realize that I rate places pretty much on food alone, not decor or atmosphere.  But the others are correct, this place is stuck in the 80's. The waitress seemed to be stuck in the 80's as well.  But the food was amazing.  I had a NY Strip, may have been the best steak I've had in Chicago.",5

Thanks Eli!!! I have no idea what kind of sauce they use on this pizza but it is really really good!! Very cheesy and just all around great!! I recently visited Chicago and was recommended this pizza place. I actually ate this delicious pizza pie on my final day in Chicago, but wish I could have found it earlier, as I would have eaten it each and every day!! The ambiance reminds me of a Soprano's episode. It's a bit of a wait and extremely filling, so make sure that you come to this spot hungry. Between three HUNGRY girls, we ordered a medium deep dish pizza, and were unable to finish the entire thing",5
"Giordanos is my favorite deep dish pizza place in Chicago and this particular location is my favorite one in town. It's kind of hidden in the little plaza just off N Michigan Ave and I think it might not get as busy as say the one on Rush. Anyway, there is a little bar area that you can sit in which also has several tvs with sports on. I prefer doing this if you are either by yourself or with one other person. There are only like 4 tables in there but if one is open, grab it. This was great the last time I was in there because we were able to watch the Packers/Giants playoff game while munching on deep dish pizza. The deep dish pizza is great. There is just something about the cheese the use there, it really is terrific. And if for some reason you aren't in the mood for pizza, try some of ",4

"Giordano's has the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Eating it is an adventure. Know that it takes a while for them to make these pizzas, as they are incredibly deep, robust pies. Also know that you can't eat as much of it as you think you can. Down here in the South, I can polish off a whole frozen Dijourno's by myself, but I honestly can't eat more than two or three slices of a small pizza at Giordano's... three is pushing it. The drink list is decent. There is Guinness. This particular Giordano's has times when it is so busy that it's worth finding another location, but in general the wait times are bearable. Always worth it.",5

We randomly found this place while wandering around in Chicago late at night, the inside is really nice, the decor is excellent. We of course got the deep dish, some morons who reviewed it who had never been there tried something else. STUPID. The pizza was damn good, the crust was weird but deep dish pizza crust is different. The cheese was excellent, tons of toppings, and the sauce was fantastic. If you're in Chicago visiting, go there for pizza. It's right across millenium park and close to the lake. This pizza is so good i'd fly to chicago again just to eat it. Great city, GREAT pizza.",5

"This pub holds a special place in my heart!  Mainly because I studied in London and Elephant & Castle was one of the stops on the Tube.  It's a little cheesy to say so, but it's true! I go here strictly because it reminds me of London... well, as much as it can.  I've only sat at the bar but every time I go here it's great.  It's not your typical party bar obviously, but it's just a quaint little pub where you can sit and a have a beer after work (or in the afternoon!).  I always get Strongbow when I'm there... it's kind of expensive but it's a cider beer so that is to be expected.   I've always had good experiences as far as service and everyone I take there loves it.  I'll have to check out the food next time I go!  But if you just want to sit at the bar with good company and good people",5
"I've waited in a line outside in the pouring rain for a Garrett's fix and I would do it again, and again, and again!  A bag of cheese, a bag of caramel, take a little from each and you've got a mix made in heaven.  Watch out for orange fluorescent fingers afterwards!",5
"DELICIOUS pizza!!!",5
"If you go here, you have to get the Chicago deep dish.  You aren't really experiencing Giordano's if you get a hand tossed pizza here.  Also, the spinach artichoke dip is incredible.  One small pizza deep dish was enough for me and my sister after the spin dip. You gotta know you will have to wait probably an hour or more if you go there for dinner.  If you are 21, you can knock a few back in the bar section while you wait for your table.  It's also really close to the Chicago Conrad hotel.  We just walked there and it took about 4 or 5 minutes.",5

"Had a deep dish pizza with veggies.  Very good.  Love the tomato sauce and the generous amount of veggies.  The waitress very good and we were able to watch Sunday football during our lunch.  Make sure you have lots of time for your meal, a deep dish pizza takes an average of 35-40 minutes to be cooked.",5
"I know that visitors to Chicago always want to go to Gino's East, but Giordano's has the best pizza in the city!This particular location is great because it's near CTA, South Shore and Metra.  It's also near Millennium Park and has a view of the beautiful courtyard at Prudential Plaza.  On a nice day - or if the restaurant is extremely busy - you can get your meal to go, complete with utensils and plates, and have a picnic in the courtyard or the park.",5
"If I'm in the mood for a great sandwich for lunch I go to Jersey Mikes. Their food is so fresh and they cut the meat right there in front of you. I love the #13 Original Italian that made Jersey Mikes famous. It has provolone, ham, prosciuttini, cappacuolo, salami and pepperoni (As you can tell I love meat!) I always make sure to get my sandwich Mike's way which adds onions, oil, vinegar and italian seasoning. Jersey Mikes is the place to go for a fresh sandwich that will be sure to fill you up.",5

"Of all the Jimmy John's locations I've been to, this is probably my favorite.  The staff here is very friendly and personable, very fast and always making sure that things are clean and orderly.  Their sandwich construction is tops (sandwich construction is very important to me).  The price here is pretty middle-of-the-road compared to other locations in the area (I mean we're only talking a difference of like 30 cents, but still).  My only gripe is that they don't have yellow/banana peppers.",5

They are perfectly salty, savory, and spicy and do not taste too watered down or heavy.  it's just the perfect thing for a post-work out beverage on a Sunday afternoon.

"I really love this place.  I've never actually been to the location as we always have it delivered to our office.   The sandwiches are consistent and delicious.  They're also really good about getting my super picky orders correct (I usually get the Corvallis on multi-grain bread - no tomatoes, and dressing on the side.). As far as I know their delivery range is pretty small, but they always accommodate a delivery to my office (at Jackson & Wacker) as long as there's a few sandwiches in the order. They are a little bit on a pricey side I suppose ($7 for the sandwich and a small side of chips, fruit, potato or pasta salad), but the sandwiches are excellent (MUCH better than a Subway or Potbelly's sandwich) so it's well worth it to stop by here every once in a while.",5

"First thing my friends and I did when we got to Chicago was find a Chicago style pizza, and luckily it was just across the street from our hotel.  We ordered the Chicago stuffed special pizza and it was as good as i thought it would be if not better.   We started out with a huge family appetizer that had like 10 mozzarella sticks, 10 wings, 6 chicken fingers 20 fried mushrooms and 30 fried zucchinis.  There was 5 of us and we couldn't finish the appetizer.  We had to wait awhile for the stuffed pizza, but when it came we each could only eat one.  We still had 3 slices that we just brought back to the hotel. We ate there again the day we left and I decided to try one of their philly cheesesteak sandwiches and I thought it was pretty good too.  And of course i had a slice of stuffed pizza.  ",5
"Free-range beef burger.  Doesn't get any better than this.  Old school buttery bun and caramelized onions to order.  Fries are fresh cut and delicious.  As others have mentioned, this is no 'low fat' burger.  It can be greasy, no lie.  (However, the dessert brownies that are tempting you on the counter aren't that good, run down to nearby Panera for a tasty pastry). Some have complained about the lack of menu options.  Personally, I like that they stick to what they know and don't put a ton of salads in the fridge case or try to sell things they are not good at.  Simply menu is the way to go. A little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it if you enjoy a good burger that was grass fed and treated humanely.  Some have mentioned that they should be paying less because it is a ",5
"FREAKING AWESOME. The Epic Burger: All natural beef patties (no hormones included) topped with fresh organic everything: onions (grilled or raw), lettuce, tomatoes, special sauce. Served on a fresh local bakery baked whole grain bun. Fresh cut fries, crispy and delicious. Even the ketchup on the table is organic. And yes, you CAN tell the difference (even if it may be all in your head). You betcha, it's a better burger than any burger you've ever had, EVER.",5
"On this visit, I was asked if I've ever rated a Giordano's less than 5 stars.  The answer is no. Even though the pizza was light on sausage and mushroom, it was delicious, flaky, doughy, cheesy goodness.  My stomach is growling for my last leftover slice right now, and it is 7:26am.  Don't judge me. I had never been to this location before and anticipated it to be less crowded than the original or any other Chicago location, but I was wrong!  There was a constant line and groups waiting outside on Friday night.  And for good reason! Vote for Giordano's!  You won't be disappointed. P.S.  It's awesome that you can pre-order your pizza as you wait.",5
"First time I went to Gioco's I got the same feeling I do when I go to a Kleiner restaurant, you feel like you're in a meat market.  Everyone checks out who's coming through the door.  Geez, I should have taken a little more time to look decent.   On the other hand, the food is consistently good and the service is usually really great.  Great wine selection and I'd have to say I like it better than the Italian restaurants in Little Italy.  It's been a few years now and it hasn't lost it's touch.  Well, it doesn't feel like a meat market anymore thank goodness.  By the way, the mussels are always amazing.",5
"I'm an outsider who recently came to Chicago to visit a friend. One of our top priorities was to try out some of the most famous deep dish pizzerias in Chicago - Pizzeria Uno, Gino's East, Lou Malnati's, and Giordano's. Giordano's came out on top (although Lou Malnati's was a very close second). Quite simply, the pizza was delicious. The defining mark of Giordano's is the cheese overload. We're talking massive, overwhelming quantities of mozzarella that will send you into a state of deep bliss. Unless you don't really like cheese, in which case this pizza would be horrible. But if you're a cheese lover like myself, it really doesn't get any better than this. The other toppings and the crust are also very good, but the cheese - oh god, the cheese - is what really brings this home. We came h",5

If you have yet to experience the magic of Chicago-style deep dish or have guests from out of town wondering what the fuss is about, go here. Also neat: if you live anywhere in the contiguous US outside of Chicago, Giordano's will ship you a half-baked pizza on dry ice for you to finish baking yourself.

"We go here at least a few times a month and the staff and food are great. In the style of the 'old school' deli with new flairs, (ie, old school= Katz's in NY, Kanter's in LA, rascal house), this place has a lot of character. I've noticed that a few people misinterpreted this as attitude...it is not... it is personality and comes with great food. The corned beef is a tasty standard, I'm a fan of the corned beef-pastrami hash (however, it doesnt work for those dieting); the lox platter is a favorite. Tried everything from omelets to burgers and all has been close to perfect. (i am quite picky and have high standards with my food as my other reviews show). None the less- hit up the bar, great bloody mary. If you go on a weekend morning expect a slight wait-- can be 5 minutes to half an hour.",5

I even met his mom once. Nice touch ;) You can taste the LUV that goes into the food.  Fresh, HUGE portions that are oh so hot and yummy!!   They offer breakfast all day, fantabulous bloody mary's, and a massive menu of all-american comfort food   The boyfriend, always orders the pastrami.  It is piled high on a number of the menu items and is always enough for two.

I find I prefer quite a bit more cheese corn in my Chicago mix, so I do it myself. It can get a little pricey, but this is one treat to try for sure. Cheesey, caramelly goodness. This is what cheese and caramel corn was meant to taste like. So satisfying! One of Chicago's, and life's little treasures.

I called Giordano's on Rush because it was the closest one to my hotel. At 10:30pm, their oven was broken! oh Shit! I'm about to be in trouble, I thought to myself. So I called the next closest location which happened to be this one and they told me to call the one on Rush. I told them their oven was broken and therefore they agreed to drive me my pizza.

Because we were treated exactly the same. I've never had a bitchy waitress in my life. And maybe no one showed up at her halloween party or something who knows what could explain her rudeness to us. We complained to management about her. But if she's still there and you happen to go, good luck, she's got short brown hair, skinny type.

"This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE only: I live across the street from this place and eat here often.  Usually, i just get the pizza for carry out.  I HATE the fact that they want to charge you for gardinaire peppers when their counterparts in the suburbs are so friendly about it.  This place specifically really needs to work on its customer service.  When you're charging 22 dollars for a large stuffed spinach, a small cup of gardinaire isn't going to kill you, and you can't count it as a topping since my g/f only wants it for her slices (2).   Secondly, I ate there last night on a dine in basis, and the service was also horrible.  I left a note at the end that said 'Why your tip stinks' and I listed the following reasons: They never refilled my water.   I asked for gardinaire pepper",1

We had to go back and ask after waiting 20 mins can someone take our order. Our server finally arrived and the food well was cold. I ordered a Tilapia sandwich which looked great but was cold. I sent it back and it seemed like it had been just popped in the microwave and it tasted like it. I figured OK they were having an off day so lets try this again. We sat in whats considered the 'Bar' area and not the booths. It was a Bears game so it was a bit crowded but not enough for yet again terrible",1
"I had been to Emerald a couple of times and thought it was a typical, mediocre downtown bar that would be universally loved (as all Irish bars are). I was surprised, however, at the blatant racism of the bartender on the Sunday before Memorial Day. Basically, the bartender does not like to serve black folks. This is easily noticed by his lack of conversation when black customers order and in his inability to get drinks to them when ordered. For example, my mate ordered a shot of SoCo and lime. It never came. So my mate went to the bar and was told, I'm out of lime juice. This, of course, makes sense. What doesn't make sense is he did not offer an alternative - like SoCo sans lime or something else? And frankly, how can a bar be out of lime juice! After another attempt to order a drink it w",1
"We stood at the door a good 5 minutes before someone seated us. We should have walked out then. We ordered the curry chips appetizer after our rude waitress asked 'OK So what do you want?'. The curry chips sounded so awesome - fries and curry sauce. I love the madras curry flavor and England is one place to get it. What we actually got was a different story - they served the fries next to a bowl of chunky potato curry that was not very saucy. We actually asked our server if she was kidding us. Did they expect us to skewer the curried potatoes with our 'chips'? I ordered one of the winter special drinks - called a cinnamon toast. It tasted like very watery (bland) cider. I don't find many places in the city that water down their drinks - because they normally cost you $10. The beer list was",1

"Went here for a post Reeling hunger quick fix and I really wish I hadn't. My chicken sandwich and fries came out to $13.00, sans tip!  That's not a diner price. Why so expensive you ask? Because the bums charge me $1.00 to switch from blue cheese to swiss cheese and $2.00 to add grilled onions. To top it off, there was nothing particularly exciting about this sandwich and the fries were mediocre. Don't get me wrong I have no problem dropping money at restaurants, but I  hate it when my food is overpriced AND doesn't live up to any sort of standard one would deem to be good The staff wasn't  friendly and no offense to my waiter, but his neither his attitude nor his hygiene was up to par.",1

Mountains of rubbery mozzarella cheese, no sauce, nothing good, let alone extraordinary! Crust sucked, veggies were soggy and droopy...meat was nothing special.  The tastiest part of the meal was the marinara sauce I had to order to dip me pizza in because there was just no sauce. This place was a major disappointment.",1

Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable.  I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least.  This happen to anyone else?

I found the decor to be dated, and the service annoying. When we did not want to order a bottle of wine, the waiter snottily asked, 'What would you like to order...water perhaps?' I found the food to be just OK, nothing to write home about. I'm happy for those of you who didn't notice the attitudes around you. As for me, I wouldn't go there again. There are too many nice restaurants in this city to waste my time at a place where the wait staff makes you feel like you should be serving them.",1

The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged.

I've enjoyed the deep dish Joe's pizza (spinach and sauteed garlic with chunky tomato sauce) at our very own Star Pizza.   So, on our last day in Chicago, I convince my work mates that we absolutely must indulge in a deep dish pizza before we leave.  They acquiesce, but not knowing the town and being limited on time, we ask one ",1
"This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE only: I live across the street from this place and eat here often.  Usually, i just get the pizza for carry out.  I HATE the fact that they want to charge you for gardinaire peppers when their counterparts in the suburbs are so friendly about it.  This place specifically really needs to work on its customer service.  When you're charging 22 dollars for a large stuffed spinach, a small cup of gardinaire isn't going to kill you, and you can't count it as a topping since my g/f only wants it for her slices (2).   Secondly, I ate there last night on a dine in basis, and the service was also horrible.  I left a note at the end that said 'Why your tip stinks' and I listed the following reasons: They never refilled my water.   I asked for gardinaire pepper",1

"Sucks!  Me and my co-worker went here for lunch one day and this was only a pick up order so I'm afraid to see what the inside service is like.   I had the bangers and mash which were ok but not that great.  The onion strings were chewy and the mashed potatoes were cold.  My co-worker had steak and ale pie which was disgusting she actually went to Popeye's chicken instead and threw her lunch out.   When I went to pick up the order I went up to the bar and told them I had an order for pick up.  Instead of asking me something like 'What name is it under?' or 'What number did you call from?'   The bartender acted like a jerk and said 'Can you be more specific?'   I'll never eat here again.",1
"Dear Deep Dish Pizza lovers and aspiring Chicago Pizza Tourists: Giordano's is the McDonald's of Chicago deep dish pizza.  Their thin crust is doughy and bland.  The dough in their deep dish has way too much sugar in it.  If you like safe, conservative and tasteless pizza, you might like G's (see Pizza Hut).  But if you want flavor and quality, look to Gino's, Uno's and Lou Malnati's.   For some torturous godforsaken reason, the company I used to work for would order this shit over and over when there's Pat's, Aurellio's and Gino's nearby.   Btw, if you want some thin crust recommendations, PM me, and my answers will be mom & pop shops, not corporate crap.  Hmmm...let's exit this review with 'peace out!'

Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable.  I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least.  This happen to anyone else?

"Travesty of a place. We arrived early on a Friday, like senior citizen early. Two of the three of us were there, and said we were waiting on a third. The place was empty, so we assumed there would be no problem getting a table when our third arrived. And as they said nothing at all about it, we had no reason to believe that the hostesses thought otherwise. So, our third ran late. We were to meet at 4, and 20 minutes go by when we hear the hostess tell someone that there was a 45 minute wait. Thinking that couldn't be right, we walked up to ask, and we were told that yes, there was a 45 minute wait because a large party was coming in. When we asked if we'd only have 25 minutes because we arrived 20 minutes ago, they said that no, it was a 45 minute wait. When we asked why they didn't say th",1

"For a chain pizza joint, I guess it was OK. Unfortunately, the crust had very little flavor. The mozzarella was good as well as the sauce. We had a small cheese and a medium combination (can't remember the name), and it was more food than four of us could eat. I think I would try another pizza place in Chicago before I would go back to Giordano's.",2

Before this, we dined in and had one of the gourmet thin crust pizzas with a calimari/zucchini appetizer.  Service was okay, but once again, we did not find much value in what we ordered.  In fact, the bottom of the calimari/zucchini was stuffed with paper to make it look much more impressive than it really was.  Not cool.  Again, the pizza was good, but probably 25% overpriced.

But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  'Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.'

The air was not very refreshing coming from the humid outdoor weather (and coming from Las Vegas where every store has sub-zero temperatures, this was not a good start). Although the wait was told at 35 minutes, is probably only took them 15 minutes to seat. When seated, however it did take another 5-8 minutes for a server to come over.

"After having had an awesome experience ordering from Lou Malnati the night before, I decided to order similar dishes from Giordano's for a head-to-head comparison.  First up, it's the fried calamari.  While Lou Malnati's version was sublimely tender with a fresh tasting cocktail sauce; the Giordano's version was tough and soggy, and the cocktail sauce tasted every bit as being poured from a bottle. Giordano's is known for it's stuffed pizza, but the minimum size was 10' versus 6' at Lou Malnati's.  It was too much pizza for one person, and I was underwhelmed by the top and bottom crusts (which is what makes it 'stuffed').  If the crust is good, then one is more than enough.  And Lou Malnati's version also came out ahead in the pizza category for me.",2

Can't say that I recommend this one...",2

"I am a lover of pizza- -If this is the best that Chicago style has to offer, then im done with it. I just cant believe that everyone loves this stuff, I try to be sensitive to geographical differences in food preference, but when if you were to administer a double-blind experiment  between other cities top pizza, I cannot be convinced that this place would even come close. cheese to sauce ratio- 4:1 Soggy quotient- 7/3 Indigenstion probabiltiy- 90% I know people like to take pride in their local standard food fare- but cmon guys, In New York we recognize our bbq is inferior to the midwest, mexican food will never be like that of Southern Cal.- Stop hatin the NY style. Lose your pizza pride and a few pounds in the process. p.s. the service was good- very good fountain soda served in large c",2
"This place is ok.  Nothing special. Ordered a hot dog and cheese fries.  Specifically asked for a Chicago style hot dog.  When asked what I wanted, I said everything.  But then he kept asking if I wanted relish, onions, tomatoes, etc.  I was really annoyed until he asked if I wanted ketchup.  NO WAY!  Ketchup on my hot dog?!  Are you kidding? I do have to say that the bun was great--perfectly steamed and not mushy or hard.  Good job. Fries here are not great.  Cheese that goes on top is gross.   Pay for a cab and go to Portillos.",2
"At $6.79/pound (no one else seems to have prices this exorbitant!), there's just no way that Garden Village Deli can stay within my lunch budget of $5.50 anymore. A pity, as they have lots of veggie options, and I could make a meal of the 1/4 sections of avocado in vinaigrette. See ya, spinach pie, grilled asparagus and sesame noodles.....you're just too darn pricey for me now.",2
"The food here is good but both times I've been in, I have had terrible service.  I would not choose to go back in for in person dining but would get something to go or for delivery.",2
"Had a double cheeseburger. Really big portions but overall bland. It didn't really taste like much.",2
"Lunch here felt functional.  Like a filling station, only less efficient. Spinach pizza was premade and came right out.  Speed good.  Taste bad.  Not fresh.  Low flavor impact.  Not nearly as good as some of my Bay Area favorites, which was especially disappointing. I'm wondering if Giordano's is still effectively 'famous' or if at this point it's merely 'widely available.'  There's a difference.",2
"This place appears to be going downhill.  Prices seem higher, portions are getting smaller (fish and chips).  Quality just hasn't been the same as it was a year ago.",2
"I was visiting Chicago for the New years weekend and was dying to eat Chicago's famous deep dish pizza but was oh! SO disappointed. Sorry Chi-towners but please tell me this is not Chicago's finest!! My Hubby & I ordered the super veggie .. and we were sorely disappointed.  The pizza was sooo bland! I also thought the cheese inside wasn't melted enough.. You know wasn't the gooey cheesy goodness i was expecting... Was more like eating a block of cold cheese stuffed inside a crust... We boxed our left-overs and microwaved it the next day and i thought it tasted better if not very good.. maybe because the cheese inside was melted enough... Having said all that... i thought the garlic bread was yummy!! (Hence the 2 stars) I am not giving up on deep dish pizza's!! Will definitely be back in Ch",2
"This is the building when you're walking down Randolph, you look over and say 'I can definitely destroy that building with my bare hands, no questions asked.' And you're probably right- you could. This place doesn't make sense, and I almost feel bad giving it two stars because it's awesomeness is derived by the fact that it doesn't make sense. Here's what I would recommend: buy a fifth or rum from somewhere and get yourself a pina colada smoothie, do your own mixing, and have yourself a good time.",2
"I think Chicago-style pizza is a great novelty. If the mood strikes me where I want to feel excessively full, fat, and truly uncomfortable after 2 1/2 slices of pizza I can just go to Giordano's. Unfortunately, I don't feel like that often, hardly ever.    I prefer Gino's East based on the cornbread crust and ambiance. It just seems less touristy there.",2
"In a word: disgusting This pizza COULD have been good, IF they cooked the effing dough.  Instead what I got was a pizza with a delightfully flaky outer edge, and a bottom that consisted of half cooked dough.  Nothing is as tasty as gooey dough, yum.  And it is 'stuffed' because they put another thin layer of dough over the top.  Then they put sauce on top of that.  So guess what other part of the crust is not cooked at all?  Bingo!  That top layer was so disgusting.  They at least put sauce on the pizza, unlike Lou Malnati's, but their sausage was not as good.  I did not like their chopped salad as much as the Malnati salad either. So Chicago, THIS is your idea of good pizza?  What a joke...",2

"I'm still trying to figure out why you took the Whitefish sandwhich off the menu. Why did you do this?? I can't explain how good it was unless I go back and look at my monthly credit card statements because I probably ordered it once a week for months until it was off the menu. Don't expect too much from this place- the food is standard pub fare w/o that Whitefish sandwhich to choose from, the beer is slightly overpriced (but that's not the end of the world). Bears games, though, are pretty good and I do enjoy the brunch and have been there for ESPN1000 (Mongo and Coppock) broadcasts. And the staff is pretty friendly- have never had a bad time. So the review is mostly for the food.",2
"Gross. Deep dish pizza is disgusting and Giordano's takes it to a whole new level. Not only does it take forever to get your pizza, but holy mole(!), your ass needs to take a nap afterward. If you insist on clogging your arteries and raising your cholesterol levels with what Chicagoans mistakenly refer to as 'pizza', go to Lou Malnati's - their pizza (and service) is better.",2
"I tried this place a couple years ago and remember not liking it. They didn't really have a clue now and don't really have one now. The omlet back then was so-so and I was a single eater and they didn't know where to put me. This time my biggest gripe was that after we finally sat and got our food, they kept trying to take empty plates and glasses that clearly had hunks of food on them. I ordered a bloody mary and they took that away before I finished the drink or even the olives! Our server was really nice and although we came as an incomplete party, we had to figure out to sit at the bar otherwise we would've waited for our party in the lobby. I get it, you don't seat incompletes but could you have our table ready when everyone gets there? I probably won't be going back because of the hy",2

"In fairness, I'm a New Yorker.  I won't belabor this point, but in short, Pizzeria Uno's has better tasting crust.  The pizza that is placed in front of you is beautiful.  It is cheesy and crusty and you have great expectations, but if you like crust with taste, not like an extended cracker, you may not like this style pizza. The place was packed and came highly recommended, but I wasn't impressed.",2
"Sorry Giordano's, but I'm not a fan of your pizza.  There's too much cheese and not enough of the other ingredients.  I wasn't sure what to make of it.  The crust is not so bad though.  The combination appetizer with mozzarella sticks, fried zucchini and fried mushrooms were okay.  The breading was good but the ingredients inside somewhat plain.  Skip this place when visiting.  Much better pizza can be had elsewhere.",2
"Usually buffets aren't my cup of sauce, but this was pretty alright.  There are two islands of food, one salads and another of entrees such as salmon, chicken, beef and vegetable melody, which consisted of broccolini and carrots.  I am always weary about food staying hot by over water, especially when that food starts with f and ends with ish.  The major reason for the low rating is for the service or shall I say, lack there of.  Running out of soda, okay no refills but water? And not as if su-waiters are standing around watching you eat.",2
"This place has the worst wings and fish and chips I have ever tasted. Just nasty...",2
"I get the sense this Gino's East is more of a tourist trap than a neighborhood eatery.  The pizza is good but vastly overpriced.   We ordered the speciality deep dish with the venison.  The 9 inch pizza could not have contained more than 7 or 8 small crumbles of venison.  When you pay $25 for a 9 inch pizza, you expect it to be loaded with ingredients.  Not here. Before this, we dined in and had one of the gourmet thin crust pizzas with a calimari/zucchini appetizer.  Service was okay, but once again, we did not find much value in what we ordered.  In fact, the bottom of the calimari/zucchini was stuffed with paper to make it look much more impressive than it really was.  Not cool.  Again, the pizza was good, but probably 25% overpriced. This iteration of Gino's East is okay if you want so",2
"I saw Johnny Rockets featured on Undercover Boss last year and it inspired me to give the restaurant I have been passing ever since they opened this location a try. This must be some knock off because I didn't get the nostalgic Americana diner experience I had hoped for and was promised to me not only by the executive featured on the show but by a sign on the wall. This is more like an express Johnny Rockets. No full service, no fun friendly or singing staff. I mean, where was the juke box, the lunch counter, the black and white pics of teens at a sock hop? OK, so the atmosphere sucked. The food was just OK. I really don't like mayo AND mustard on my burger - it causes all the other stuff to slip around and it's just not the mess I need the street traffic on Lake and State to see as I eat ",2
"I don't get it- deep dish pizza. It's really a lasagna but has layers of bread instead of noodles. And the bread isn't anything wonderful or distinctive- like a San Francisco sourdough, say. The regulars here know that there's a 40 min wait for the pizza to be delivered to the table from the time the order is placed. That's a looong time. I think it's an annoying affectation. You can go to the finest gourmet restaurant and order an item, and it's brought to the table fresh and hot a lot sooner. Think about it. A leg of lamb, a prime rib, an apple cobbler. The restaurant doesn't start from scratch when you order. Giordano's is a cult  and they've got diners believing that the pizza tastes better when they make you wait. The wait only makes you hungrier and you THINK the food is better than ",2
"I had a very disappointing experience at this Giordano's. I got there about 10 minutes before it closes and asked if they were still open. They told me they were, but a few minutes later, after I ordered a deep dish pizza, the waitress told me they had 'turned the oven off' and therefore they couldn't make me a pizza (who knows f that is true? About 10 minutes after that they served a pizza to another table, so maybe they just didn't want to wait for the pizza to bake). The waitress was also not very attentive and took about 15 minutes to bring the drinks we ordered... (although the place was almost empty) I am not going back to this Giordano's - and maybe not even to other Giordano's. You can eat the same or better deep dish pizza at several other places in Chicago (e.g., Uno/Due).",2
"We went here two times, once for brunch. super small menu and ok food. chowed here for dinner as well, can't say I'd go back. it's very carnivore savvy menu, i don't eat land animals, so we were limited to pasta and pizza.. not impressed.. it's really nice and looks like it's a rocking place, also, it could be the loudest place in Chicago.. friendly staff..",2
"It's hard for me to make up my mind about Gioco.  I really want to love it, but I can only like it.  And it seems I like it a little less with each visit.  I've been here four times over several years, and it just seems that it isn't as good as it used to be.   Why do I want to love Gioco?  Because it's semi-local and because it just has a sort of cool vibe.  I like the bricks.  I like the bar.  And I like the open kitchen, as long as the place is somewhat busy.  If it's not busy, it will seem like the kitchen staff is laser beaming you. The problem with Gioco for me is that there's not much on the menu I can eat due to my ever present picky palate.  I've gone with the steak on most occasions.  Once I had the pasta with ragu meat sauce.   The steak is good, but I think it was best the firs",3
"I don't like deep dish Chicago pizza.  My friends wanted to try it and we came here because it was close.  I've done the others (UNO and Gino's East) and this was good too.  Again, I'm not a person to rate pizza, but since both my husband and I are anti deep dish, we got other menu items and really liked them.  I got pasta with meat sauce and he got ravioli.  Both dishes were really good and I really like their tomato sauce.  Delicious.  The service was awesome and they have good mints on your way out the door.",3
"As many have mentioned, this place has multiple names and is located in a food court that reeks of fast food and depressing times.  If you can overlook these things, then you will be able to get pho in the Loop, which is nearly impossible.   As I'm not a pho expert, I can't speak to whether or not this is authentic.  HOWEVER, I always leave full and in want of a nap rather than returning to work.  The staff is so nice!  They have mango smoothies!  The bibimbap is on par with it being a food court, but not a shady one!  So, just go here, try it out, you will definitely enjoy it, even if your clothes smell like pho/Popeye's/McDonald's/orange chicken afterwards.  What's the alternative?  Getting the food carryout so that you can enjoy your pho, jap chae, bibimbap and smoothie on the go.

"I mean, it's just not my thing.  I'm used to dive bars and jukeboxes.  The place was nice and small and very chic.  ALOT of business people too.  They have a martini menu and I ordered the pomegranate one.  It was very good.  Tried the chicken pizza too, that was good.  I came here for a mixer, the atmosphere was nice and I liked the lighting.  The martini was $10.   It seems like a good place to meet after work if you work downtown but it was kind of trek for me so I may not be coming too far into downtown to have another martini.",3
"We order from here from work and the food is okay.  I just went here this past Friday night for a rehearsal dinner.  While I wasn't in the wedding or even a member of the family, I could see the stress in the eyes of the bride and her family.  The bride had made a reservation for the back room months in advance.  Then the day before the event someone at Giordano's booked the same room for 3 bus loads of people.  Sure I understand you need to make money for your business, but you should always accommodate the guests that have booked well in advance and not have 50 people standing your lobby.   So once that was all settled and we were seated we were having issues getting everyone enough soda and water.  When the food came out, some of the pizzas were cooked and some where not.  Good think I ",3
"Well, what do you know?  The second meal here would be deep dish once again!  Can't get enough of it, I guess? This place has quite a different feel from Gino's.  It was more brightly lit and there was no graffiti.  There was plenty of seating, so we were at our table right away. I think I was more hungry, so I felt prepared to finish the pizza this time around.  We ordered a small instead because we learned our lesson the night before.  Sausage topping again.  Don't know why.  I guess we wanted to try crumbled.  We also ordered garlic bread to help with the wait.  The bread was not bad, the sauce was okay.  It wasn't as good as Gino's sauce.  The pizza actually came a little quicker this time.  The pizza was slightly different from Gino's.  I think it's more cheesy, which I wouldn't consi",3
"This is not a dig to this particular store, but a beef that I have with Jimmy Johns in general.  Where are the freaking pickles? I'm astounded by this. It keeps me up at night. I'm convinced that Jimmy John's is just a front for a spy organization that will be the demise of us all, because we all know it's un-American to serve a sub without pickles. And a big fat pickle on the side is NOT the same.  What am I supposed to do- lob an entire half pickle on my sandwich?  If you ask me, it's adding insult to injury.  Because you know they have pickles there but they won't slice them right.   Otherwise their sandwiches are dece, but I'm too busy flying into a fit of rage every time I get one because they don't have pickles!!!   I think I should go lie down now.   xoxo",3
"I like that this is right across the street from my loft.  I love Jewish style diner's.  I love the patty melt and the corned beef sandwich.  This place would get more stars if the prices were not so HIGH.  You pay $5.95 for a slice of cheesecake and close to $12 for a Chicken Caesar salad!  Yikes...",3
"I finally returned to Eleven City.  We waited for over twenty minutes for brunch, and after realizing that it would probably be another twenty minutes or more, we left.  While I waited, I perused the menu and just got irritated.  The breakfast menu was just so overpriced and it seemed like they would nickel-and-dime you for everything.  $12 for french toast?? Really??  I'll probably still go back for some lunch though.... Over to my trusty Yolk we went for a fabulous breakfast at half the price!",3
"I really enjoy my Tasty Turkey on a Challah roll at Einstein's, so I was very excited to see a new location up near my job.  Since they are new, I have cut them a break, but it just seems to me that there is no order at this location.  Sometimes my order takes forever, sometimes its quick.  And one time they told me I had to order my Tasty Turkey on the Asiago Cheese as advertised.  I was very upset, because I am very particular about my Challah roll.   Breakfast has fared better, I do enjoy their thin bagel sandwhiches, but a couple times they have been out of certain items.",3
"Thought this place was pretty good. Definitely solid. Was the food good to very good? Definitely. It was kind of overpriced though, esp since it's essentially a diner. But I'd go back for sure.",3
"This place gets a ton of hype but afterwards you're going to need a ton of pepcid.  The deep dish is their signature product, but its a huge gut bomb consisting mainly of mozerella cheese.  This place def. caters to tourists and gets pretty busy.  Skip the line and sit in the bar.",3
"Pancake (plain buttermilk) was dry.  Toast was good and eggs were okay.  I really wanted to like this place more.  The decor was really cute.  I'll give this place a second try and either get the tofu scramble or the french toast that everyone raves about.  I think this place is a little overpriced, especially the drinks.",3
"Eh.  It wasn't awful, but the way they hype up their burgers, they're very forgettable.  Waitress screwed up my drink order about three times, and it was just beers.  It wasn't too far off, as she'd get the family of brands right, such as Sam Adams, but if I asked for a Noble Pils, a Boston Lager would return.  It really didn't bother me too much and became a kind of fun game of what she would return with.  If I lived nearby, I could see myself going here as my local, but since I'm a few miles away, I likely won't return.",3
"Love this place.  First time I had ever heard of Smithwicks, so naturally I tried it with my shepherds pie.  Just excellent.  Portions were large, atmosphere was sort of like being in Alan Quartermain's sports club, old style with heavy dark wood, and brass highlights.  Good choice for taking visitors and friends for a drink.",3
"For $9, I expected to be 'wowed' by my burger. It was ok, but it was more of a $6 burger than a $9 burger.  The cheese spread 'appetizer' was nice.  Also, their beers are not exactly expensive, but at $5 and up they are on the higher end of what I expect to pay for a pint in Chicago.  I suppose I'd go back if I was already in the area because the food was decent - but I wouldn't make a special trip.",3
"Had to try a place that calls itself 'epic burger'. I also wanted something good and different for lunch today so I'd thought I would give epic a try.  After all they have some pretty good reviews.  They have the all natural thing going so i've been on the natural kick lately and wanted to try it.  I got the epic burger combo on a wheatbun +1 star. Natural hand cut fries +1 star.  Quick service, guess what, +1 star.   Nice overall.  Burger was juicy, added some bacon just cause I can (everything is better with bacon).  I'm not sure about epic's special sauce, it's kinda blah.   I'll forgo it next time.  And yes there will be a next time.  Its close to work and has good food...

There were maybe 15 diners for 3 hours. The food was good, not plentiful, but not spectacular. The service was good, very attentive, yet not stifling. I wouldn't go back because there are so many good restaurants in Chicago, why not try others?",3

"I want this place to be so good I think my expectations are too high.  Its like a high end Manny's with alcohol and a soda jerk. The diner theme is great and the space is airy and classic (a treat for your parents if they grew up in Chicago).  But many items on the menu are just  a bit off.  I grew up on latkes with a Lithuanian grand mother and mother, and their homemade potato pancakes were amazing!  What they serve as latkes here are not what I remember, nor do my parents.   The sandwiches can be a bit much as well if you don't usually ingest 3,000 calories in a sitting.  The open faced reuben has so much cheese on it you can't even see the meat.  This might be heaven for some, but its just not my style. This is not to say that I don't return here.  There is enough on the menu to satisf",3
"Most of the food is not bad, but completely unremarkable. One glaring exception, however, is the matzoh ball soup which is supposedly based on the owner's mother's recipe.  I don't know what kind of Jewish household he grew up in, but this is the blandest soup and the least fluffy matzoh ball I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot).   Not bad for what it is -- the fiancee likes the tuna melts and raves about the 'big salad.'  But if you want authentic Jewish deli food in this neighborhood, head to Manny's instead.

"I enjoyed Giordano's - I took co-workers here for a Chicago pizza experience.  I know that others have said Giordano's is not the *best ever* Chicago style pizza, but its location close to Millenium Park and its reputation made it a good choice at the time. My coworkers and I enjoyed it.  The pizza was good.  Also got a salad, which was more than enough food.  I cannot complain, but I could also see how it is considered quite touristy.  I can't, however, give it a bad review.",3
"Deep dish pizza is on my top favorite foods to eat, and Giordano's is famous for having great deep dish pizza.  I have eaten here a few times, because their individual lunch deep dish pizzas are quick, inexpensive and they fulfill my need for a pizza fix. Why do i give them 3 stars only?  For starters, the service is terrible.  Each time I've gone to this location, our waitress was rude and slow.  The ingredients are mediocre quality and the price for a regular pizza is not worth the cost. 1 large pizza will run you about $30+.  For that much money for pizza, I want great quality ingredients.   There are other great deep dish pizza restaurants in Chicago.  I'm open to suggestions on which to try next.",3
"Just OK.  Menu is limited but interesting, burgers are well cooked with quality meat, fries are just mediocre.. decor is interesting.  Don't know if I would return.",3
"Yes, Giordano's is always Giordano's - famouse Chicago deep dish pizza. It IS tasty! But the service in this place... Why do the waitreses NEVER smile? Once we had a party, and I ordered catering from this location of Giordano's. I came to them, and they didn't even have a catring menu... But the catering by itself was ok, all the guests enjoyed it.",3

However I've discovered that I HATE the lunchtime small 'baby' pizza.   After trying a different pizza place my first day I was excited to end my trip with a great pie... however the person I was with didn't want Peperoni so I was worried I wouldn't get the full experience.. Then when we saw the personal sized pizzas I thought i'd found my saving grace.. Little did I know it would be cold.   Never order the lunchtime special..

Other falafel sandwiches have tried and come up short- falafels too gritty, wrong/goopy combination of toppings, too far away from the office, etc.   I've passed by this place many times on my quest (it's easy to miss- downstairs with the Roma Pizza and Dunkin Donuts), although today was the first time that our paths crossed.  I asked the Oracle if this falafel sandwich might be the one (read: I ate it).  The answer: this is not the one.  However, with the right amount of training (use a thicker pita that does not fall a",3
"I love me some Chicago.  I and was determined to fall in love with the Chicago food staple - the deepdish pizza - so trying Giordano's was a must. I really wish I could give this place more stars, but here are the reasons for docking of two stars: 1) Took forever.  We were seated promptly, but we didn't get our drinks for the longest time.  Deepdish pizza naturally takes a long time to make, but the wait was almost unbearable considering we were starving.  Good thing we ordered some fries to tie us down during the 45 minute wait. 2) We settled for this place instead of Gino's East.  We were a bit a way from that place and was too lazy and too hungry to go there.  Perhaps we should have.  The thought 'maybe Gino's is better' lingering in the back of your mind keeps your from fully enjoying ",3
"I love pizza but I like them deep dish style. So when I got to Chicago, deep dish pizza was on top of the priority list. Getting lost on the street of Chicago, my friend Kathy and I came upon groups of hungry people waiting to get seated outside Giordano's. We immediately decided that this is the place to try! The hostess adviced us that we should order after 45 mins of waiting. Hungrily, after 45 mins, my friend and I ordered the Antipasto Salad and a smallest size pizza, 10 inches stuffed spinach pizza. After that, we waited another half an hour, which meant we waited an hour and half for pizza. Starving as I walked to the table, I thought to myself, this better be good! The Antipasto Salad came with imported ham, Genoa salami, Provolone cheese, black olives, red onion, pepperocini peppe",3
"Not sure why I come back but I do every time! Maybe it's just for the convenience.  Yep, that's really it.  In addition, the food is pretty decent.  I will say its definitely not for the great feeling that I get when I walk in the door.  The food is good and I will say that I really enjoy the protein scramble, french toast, and the turkey burgers.  The food is ample and fills my tummy. However there is one thing that I don't appreciate, that is the rudeness of one owners.  He is definitely sarcastic.  I understand that he's truly busy on Saturday's.  But you don't have to be mean to customers.  This is totally unacceptable.  I say if he get's rude with you just walk up the street to Yolk.

Fare wise, I have only had their sliders, which are okay.  They seem to have a tinge of sweetness that may be from the bun which is a bit interesting.  The thin cut fries we got at the latest visit were like those shoestring potatoes you get in the tin at the store - dry and crunchy.  No, tanks for nuh-tin.   I have to give Grace's kudos for having Two Brothers Domaine Dupage on tap.  I highly recommend you try a pint of this brew.  You'll be buying six packs of it at the store af",3

And I'm not one to turn my nose up at a free lunch. But I do turn my nose up at bad pizza, so I had a sandwich instead. I tried the crunchy pulled pork sandwich, and it was actually very good! Our waitress was very nice (she called me 'honey', and not in a condescending way) and service was good. So...I'm bumping this place up to A-OK. I still don't recommend the thin crust pizza, but there is some good stuff to be had here and they have a respectable beer selection.",3
"I feel kinda iffy about epic burger. On the one hand, I like that they had turkey burgers, whole wheat buns, etc. The fries were pretty good (didn't try the shakes - although someone else had and liked theirs.) That being said, I thought the turkey burger was kind of weird. It's very thin and the edges are really really thin. A bit hard to describe, but once you see it you'll know what I mean.

"It's hard to check off your must-do's in a city like Chi-town when you've only got 2 days to do it ... we had to be efficient with our time.

I was astounded at how packed this place was when we got there. Luckily, shortly after putting our name down on the wait list (and subsequently ordering our pie - which they recommend to people who are on the wait list), two seats opened up a the bar. My first recommendation is to NOT go to Giordano's if you're starving ... we waited approximately 40 minutes for our pizza, and it was a small pie. Don't let the size fool you, though. As a NYer, I'm used to thin crust pizza. This pizza's deep dish is compri",3

"Bleckh! Not like this is the restaurants fault but the patio has go to go! Sitting there listening to the screetching and squealing of the train going by 10 feet above my head every 3 minutes was like listening to fingers on a chalk board. Well, why didnt we just sit inside, you ask? There was a wait and we were in a hurry. To add to my experience that wasnt off to a good start, I ordered Guinness Stew and was accidentally served a big pile of poo. They tried to disguise the look by sprinkling some chopped tomatoes and green onion on it. The first and only other time I had Guinness stew was in the originating country of the dish; Ireland. And it was good! tender juicy, melt in your mouth pieces of beef mingling in a hearty sauce with tender root veggies all served in a crock. What I got at",3
"Been there twice, first time on weekend (bring a paper for the wait) and the last time got a table as soon as we walked in.  Let me be brief, i had the Reuben both times and i probably would only go back for that.  First time, my Reuben was phenomenal, this last time, i think it was sitting in the window for a little longer than it should have (cheese was kind of dry).   Here's a tip, to help over look the mediocre service , the loud setting, and the screaming owner who demeans his staff,.....try one of their BLOODY MARYS!!! YUM,...its bananas...b-a-n-a-n-a-s !",3
"We order from here from work and the food is okay.  I just went here this past Friday night for a rehearsal dinner.  While I wasn't in the wedding or even a member of the family, I could see the stress in the eyes of the bride and her family.  The bride had made a reservation for the back room months in advance.  Then the day before the event someone at Giordano's booked the same room for 3 bus loads of people.  Sure I understand you need to make money for your business, but you should always accommodate the guests that have booked well in advance and not have 50 people standing your lobby.   So once that was all settled and we were seated we were having issues getting everyone enough soda and water.  When the food came out, some of the pizzas were cooked and some where not.  Good think I ",3
"What a charming deli/diner. I relaxed here out side with  a BLT and  beer on  a SUnday afternoon. The food wasn't anything to rave about but it was good. The service was excellent and the portions were enormous for the price.",3
"I have to write this review based on my idea what edible pizza is and not on whatever standards Chicago deep-dish pizza adheres to. That being said, I should also note that my idea of a deep-dish pizza will forever be marred by the deliciously, corn-mealy goodness of Little Star. If it ain't Little Star it's probably just 'a'ight'. [See here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/ So what gives? It's hard for me to even type this, but I gotta say: My Giodano's pizza had way too much cheese. Coming from someone who can never go vegan due to her propensity towards cheese consumption, I found the lukewarm, half-inch-thick layer of cheese on my pizza inedible. I pulled about half off before eating my slice, in a classic 'I'm doing what's best for the both of us' break-up. In the end, I suppose I'm the one ",3
"I have a co-worker that swears by this place. She claims Jersey Mike's possess the best subs ever made. She told me this place is a staple in the burbs...I never heard of it Due to a lunch scheduling mishap I had a chance to check this joint out. Got there before a long line formed and was greeted by two employees. One I got near the register another girl greeted me by asking to take my order. I told her I had never been there before and I needed to look at the menu board. I noticed they had a turkey provolone sandwich (a #7). They have 3 sizes: small, regular and giant. I decided to have a regular #7. They have 2 lines: Cold Sub Line and Hot Sub Line. I was in the cold sub line. Once in line after you order, the very friendly sandwich making staff will ask you if you want regular or Mike'",3
"My lowish rating really isn't aimed at the facility itself, it was clean, and had a pretty decent interior geared towards people who like checkered tablecloths. I come from Los Angeles, where the idea of a deep dish pizza is virtually unheard of. I was excited to approach this foreign behemoth with an open jaw and open mind. The pizza itself is really thick..layer after layer of cheese, way too many ingredients sandwiched in there, and yet you never taste them! The price and wait time (40 minutes) is pretty inconvenient and kind of ridiculous. At the the end of the day, this place is well-situated near Millennium Park and is a fixture for any Chicago visit.",3
"Great service and cool ambiance. Turkey and Roast Beef sandwich was good but my friends Rueben looked much better. I'd go again if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way.",3
"Pizza has to be one of my favorite foods. So it's takes a lot to disappoint me in this category. After giving  Giordano's a few tries they have done the impossible by disappointing me. For all the hype this place gets, the pizza did not meet expectations. The tomato sauce on the deep dish pizza was overwhelming and didn't taste fresh. I had to drink a lot of water after my first slice because the bread was so thick and dry. When you bite into it feels like you are just biting through layers. The tomato sauce, cheese, and bread doesn't feel integrated. Their thin crust however was solid. But its hard to mess up a thin crust pie. The wait staff are very nice. Overall the pizzeria is average. I don't sit at home and drool thinking about this place. I would only come back if friends invited me",3
"Went to Giordanos back in September. I had pretty high expectations for this place because of all the hype. Unfortunately I ended up pretty disappointed and was not too impressed with the pizza at all. I definitely think NYC pizza tastes way better. Sorry Chicago, but NYC definitely kick butt in regards to the pizza department. What we ordered: 2 deep dish pizza. One with ham and pineapple and the other with mushroom and pepperoni. The pizza was way too doughy and there wasn't enough sauce. The cheese tasted pretty good but that was about it.   The line for this place was super long so we ordered take out but ended up sitting near the bar. I am not sure if we had to put our name down for those seats but we just sat down and since no one said anything to us, we just ordered a few drinks and",3
"I like that this is right across the street from my loft.  I love Jewish style diner's.  I love the patty melt and the corned beef sandwich.  This place would get more stars if the prices were not so HIGH.  You pay $5.95 for a slice of cheesecake and close to $12 for a Chicken Caesar salad!  Yikes...",3
"Three blocks east of work, so we decided it would be an adventurous stop on our part to start happy hour there. The sharing plates are tasty and reasonably priced, as is the beer. The 'but...' factor? I think my coworker said it best when we walked in: 'um, is it just me or does it smell like old people in here?' no offense to the geriatric, but he was right. Again, close to a ton of places in the loop (across from the Bank of America building -easy ATM access!). Fun crowd. But that smell...",2
"We went in tonight with a group of 7 after a softball game for some food and drinks. Our waitress was nice but was really dang slow with our bill. Seriously, she dropped it off and didn't come back until one of us went to find her. This was like 15 minutes or so. The food was alright. Everyone in my party got the burger special which was $4.95 burgers with fries and $1 topping. One person's order got messed up, it was 'well done' when he asked for 'medium.' It was also missing a topping. Then it came back out like 2 minutes later with the topping on there so we assume that they sent out the same 'well done' burger. This was notified to the waitress and she comped the burger. The other burgers were almost all there, cooked as ordered but still, everyone said it was kind of dry. My sister sa",3

"Ehhhhh. I'm starting to wonder if the city can ever actually pull off an authentic Irish bar (see: Ballydoyles in Downers Grove as your template). Most don't even try. Those ones just slap an Irish name on and hang a Guinness poster on the way to the mens' room. The rest quickly devolve into Johnny O'Tooligans Irish Drinking Emporium where the decor certainly says all the right things, but the soul is lacking. Emerald Loop is more of the latter. The decor is certainly nice, but I would see this place as more of a lunch spot instead of a happy hour or dinner spot. The place got loud surprisingly quickly. I'm not sure if that's a function of the music or the crowd, but when I was on the same side of a bar table, and still can't hear the person sitting right next to me, there's a problem. You",3

"I mean, it's just not my thing.  I'm used to dive bars and jukeboxes.  The place was nice and small and very chic.  ALOT of business people too.  They have a martini menu and I ordered the pomegranate one.  It was very good.  Tried the chicken pizza too, that was good.  I came here for a mixer, the atmosphere was nice and I liked the lighting.  The martini was $10.   It seems like a good place to meet after work if you work downtown but it was kind of trek for me so I may not be coming too far into downtown to have another martini.",3
"It was okay but I asked if they could put everything that is standard for a sub in a bowl for a salad and they said no.  Why?  You have bowls... I'm not asking for anything else... Strange. I opted for a chicken sub and just scraped everything off the bun.  It was still delicious but they should have been a bit more accomadating.",2

That's Emil's.",3
"Let me start by saying that I LOVE pizza, I love thin crust, I love thick Chicago style and everything inbetween. But what I don't love is this place. It was ok. Nothing too special. If you compare it to Zachary's in Oakland its mediocre at best. Maybe we had a bad pie but I don't think so..pretty bland, except the sausage, that was the pizza saver. But literally the only true flavor was in the sausage. Next time I'll go for Gino's East.",3

The beer selection was great, and this is a nice change to the lack of pubs in the SL.",3
"I feel kinda iffy about epic burger. On the one hand, I like that they had turkey burgers, whole wheat buns, etc. The fries were pretty good (didn't try the shakes - although someone else had and liked theirs.) That being said, I thought the turkey burger was kind of weird. It's very thin and the edges are really really thin. A bit hard to describe, but once you see it you'll know what I mean. I found it to be odd and not terribly enjoyable because of that. Overall, not my favorite place.",3

"This Gold Coast Dog is pretty good, and the first one I ever went to. Really, really tasty burgers (have to love a place that tops their burgers with classic hot dog toppings, pickle spear included) and mediocre fries. I do enjoy the Merkt's Cheddar squeezed on, and the burgers are always pretty juicy, thanks to perpetually soaking half-cooked in a broth bath. The dogs are okay, and the beef is 'eh.'  The latter being a little flavorless and the the former being burnt to a crisp more often than not. I understand and embrace the 'char' aspect, but they go a little overboard here. The knocking aspect of Gold Coast Dogs is that they are brutally inconsistent from store to store. The Wabash location is worlds apart from the one in Oglivie as is the one out in the 'burbs by O'Hare. It seems the",3

"I went here a bunch of times during the 2 weeks of staying in Hotel71, which is right down the street from one of their locations. Pretty much it's regular bar/ pub food. Burgers and wraps with regular appetizers like quesadillas. The food is nothing special, but really hits the spot if you're hungry and in a rush to eat. The food always came out quickly and well prepared. My main problem with Elephant & Castle is the wait staff. I went about half a dozen times and had a different waiter/ waitress each time. You would think that at least one of them would have given us good service, sadly that did not happen. Each time our waiter/ waitress forgot something, the silverware, the drinks, our appetizer. It wasn't terribly busy any of the times I went, so the mishaps can't be blamed on an over ",3

Our waitress was very sharp and friendly.  The food was good. Mom enjoyed it! :) The benefit experience...that was a little different.  The staff was rude. The party room was packed and they probably should have offered us a bigger room or consulted with the hosting the party about the number guests.   I would still return to the Emerald Loop for lunch or dinner again.",3

The food is mostly made to order and they can customize things for you. The smoothies are also good. Yes, it may not look very clean, has been shut down by the health department a few times, and the woman behind the counter may seem to be a little stern, but that's why it's called the shack.",2

I was pretty disappointed.  First, my friend had a stroller (albeit an extremely large one) with her.  And, yes, the requisite baby.  The manager wouldn't allow her to have the stroller next to the table, claiming it was a fire hazard.  We didn't see how it was any different than having a chair pulled up the end of our booth, but whatever.  Anyway, there was much commotion and moving around.  They were not terribly understanding about the situation and my friend said she'd been there before and had the stroller next to the booth.

"Giordano's was our first stop when we arrived in Chicago. We ordered a small deep dish special (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions), thinking all 2 of us could finish it and still have room for a lil somethin-somethin, no problem. We waited about half an hour or so for the Pizz-a-pie to arrive, and when it did- good lo' - can you say Behemoth. We must've stared at it for a good minute and thought, oh, shi7. Needless to say, I finished my slice but couldn't dare to start another. I know, weak. I'm usually a heff, believe. But surprisingly it wasn't the size of the pizza that stopped me at 1 slice, it was the taste. I'm a tomato sauce girl when it comes to pizza, but this one seemed to have little on it, and the flavors weren't screaming at me. The pizza tasted a bit bland, even a",3
"The Chinese food is delicious and the large portions are indeed large enough for two meals.  If you ask them to withhold the vegetables in your entree, I think they feel obligated to add more meat to fill-up the container so bonus.  The food is quite salty so beware.  My only complaint was that I ordered online, added the tip to my total, paid by credit card and saw on my receipt from the delivery man that they wrote in another tip (5%) for themselves on top of the tip I already paid. The more I order from this place, the more annoyed I get.  I ordered online again and noted I had a coupon for 15% off my order over $20.00.  The order was more like $40.00.  They didn't apply the coupon at all.  Why hand-out flyers if you're not going to honor them?  Also, I hate getting a phone call after e",1

Yes, it's a bit of a tourist trap and you can't really sit down and snack while you are there but the popcorn is good! Tried the Chicago Mix (cheese and caramel together). Good but not my fav. Love the traditional caramel but the highlight had to have been the caramel with cashews! Although the apple cider was also pretty tasty. Might have developed diabetes while I was there. Worth it!",4
"I went here for the first time today. There was no line because it was 5 or so, on a Sunday, so the lack of a wait was my main catalyst to enter. It was kind of on the higher end of what I'm willing to pay for popcorn, but if you split the cost by sharing a bag with someone it would be reasonable(they give you a solid amount).  I was very hungry, so with that in mind you might want to qualify my review.. The pairing of sweet caramel crispness with greasy artificial-yellow cheesy saltiness made me feel like a chubby stoner. I could almost hear my taste buds talking to each other.    'dude....this is almost as good as cottage cheese with..uhh umm.     'dude.. take another handful.' by the time I got the bag home, nothing remained but tiny little leftover pieces.

The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the location that they put us. It was too close to the other table and I kept having to move anytime someone got up or when staff cleaned the table. The Pizza was worth the hassle however.",4

Highly recommended Chicago experience.",4

People seem to think it doesn't live up to the grandeur that's expected of the Loop, but I disagree. I'm in the Loop quite a bit, and it's not all the Palmer House, the Lyric, and friggin One Sixtyblue. Exchequer is styled after old brew pubs that may be considered more 'rustic,' but it's a clean, comfortable place to stop in for a beer and an appetizer on the fly.",4

Thank goodness for Yelp (and for Tom and Angie X's review). Within 15 minutes, I was back at my desk and devouring the #9 steak pho. Mmm. I was also psyched to find that Green Apple offers up some of my favorite Korean dishes, like soondubu, chap chae, and bibimbap. A place that sells pho + Korean food + frozen yogurt is like something I would have come up with in my wildest dreams. Enough said. I still have to come back to try the Korean food, but I'm pretty sure I've found my newest fave lunch spot.",4

"I have to say, even if you're not a fan of popcorn, you're gonna love Garrett's. The flavor of cheese and caramel together is genius. Along with the freshness of the popcorn, it's truly a deadly combination. I mean it. I will seriously die of a clogged artery if I lived in Chicago. I have to mention, though, it really depends on the time and location. At first, I thought it was smart of me to walk into a Garrett's that was not busy so I didn't have to wait in the horrendous line at the other Garrett's I've seen, but boy was I wrong. The first batch I got was not warm, and even a few pieces were stale. But even then, I thought the flavor was good. That's why the next day, I attempted to walk into a Garrett's that had a line right out the door. This time, the popcorn was hot and crunchy. The",5

So, I went here on a convention once and boy was I pleased.  You cannot get stuffed pizza this good anywhere on the west coast.  So we're all kind of buzzed from the nice cool pitcher(s) of beer that we managed to polish off while they were baking our 14' large stuffed pie, and we have some friends from Southern California there, and they are absolutely starving, and we sort of forgot to tell them that they give you forks and knives for a reason.  Hot pizza sauce, short pants, good times.",4

I would definitely come back!",4

"My fiance and I live in the loop and love this place as our 'corner' bar. It's a great location to watch a game be it baseball, football or basketball. If you're going to eat there, I highly recommend their pizza. It's perfect bar pizza but it actually has delicious flavor and you can tell how fresh it is by the way it's cooked and the toppings. They have a full bar there but I would recommend sticking to beer. Their cocktails aren't as inexpensive as they should be and are sometimes weak. Their beer selection is pretty good though and they sell pitchers which is always a plus in my book. During a commercial break, be sure to observe the people around you. The regulars in this place are like characters from 'Cheers' or 'The Simpson's'. Definitely a great people watching location!",4

I had the special with sausage, cheese, green peppers, mushrooms & spinach etc, which was great as usual.  We didn't have to wait at all to be seated, but the pizza took about 45minutes to come out. I was starving, but it hit the spot!",4
"It's just way to tempting to have this place at the corner where dozens of buses and trains go breezing by every day.  You will see many happy commuters munching away on their tasty, fresh popped corn.  You have to get the combo bag - butter, carmel and cheese all rolled into one.  How cool is that?!",4
"I love opening day of a new restaurant (or chain). You get a warm welcome at the door; the staff is excited; its picture perfect. Overall, things seem to be running smoothly so far. It's really hard to judge a book by its cover at this stage in the game though. Maybe I need to stop in a month from now at 12:00pm to see some chaos. The food is ok. The burger was good, and done quickly. The fries, however, I can't really say that I'm a fan of. I hate flimsy fries. What I don't understand is why this place shares a space with Halsted Street Deli. That is super weird and I can only imagine that when its busy, its going to be nightmare for people getting their drinks at the soda fountain. But maybe their timeliness with filling orders will keep that from happening. We shall see.",4
"Tasty, huge burgers, amazing Epic Sauce, and I seriously just love the name. Love that they offer wheat buns and while I haven't tried a milk shake, I hear they're fantastic. I can't give 5 stars because they're kinda pricey for a fast-food environment, and I wish they offered the smaller burger with the combo of fries/drink.",5
"I had some pretty good deep dish here. I ordered just a slice of cheese and it got to out table pretty quickly. It just tasted really fresh and warm, I guess it was  a bit expensive for me but I'm definitely a fan",4
"I like the deep dish here, perhaps even more than the original Uno's (is this a travesty?).  The crust is crisp outside, soft inside, and it's not oily.  The cheese is super elastic.  The sausage is spicy, flavourful, and sliced generously.  The bread is warm and fresh.  Soda refills are free. One star off for service - the last time I came here, it wasn't busy but the server forgot our drinks and neglected our table. Call ahead with your order so you don't have to wait 45 minutes for pizza.  Don't stray from deep dish either!  I tried their baked pasta, and it basically was regular ziti with a slice of mozzarella melted (microwaved?) over it.",5
"Wandered in here after the Shamrock Shuffle. Everything was really quick, which is great. We were seated right away, our waitress was very engaging and fast, and it was very comfortable. Decor isn't anything special, but, it has a warm, feel to it with a lot of history. The food was alright. I ordered the Cajun Chicken Alfredo. It was pretty tasty but I've had better... and worse. One thing I loved however, was that the waitress left a shaker of Parmesan Cheese at the table. Little things like that make me happy.",4
"We frequent this little joint on our lunch hour occasinally and it's pretty good. Not bad not amazing just good chineese at a decent price. If your going to eat in be warned that it's pretty warm during hotter days. The sesame chicken is pretty tasty as well. Prices are decent and you get a good value for your money.",4
"Never having had Chicago style deep dish pizza before, I was very intrigued and surprised trying it for the first time. I always thought deep dish pizza just meant thicker crust and more dough. But it turns out Chicago deep dish pizza isn't 'deep' in a sense that the dough is thicker, but more so it's deep like a pie. In fact, the crust is actually quite thin! It's the many layers of toppings and cheese that makes it thick. My friends and I ordered the 'Large Special Deep Dish Pizza ($26.75) - Sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions'. It took 40 mins to prepare and cook, and we were tempted to order other things on the menu like salad and pasta while we waited. But we persevered, and when it finally came, it was worth it! The large pizza is cut into 8 slices that are seemingly manageable",4
"I went for the Jan. special - 2 course dinner for $20. I had the New York strip steak - it was freaking delicious. And I'm not a huge meat eater. I also had the salad - it was good, typical. I had the apple tort for dessert - not so great. But who cares? The steak was that memorable. There were many interesting adventures on the menu otherwise - some rabbit, some crazy seafood, things like that. I'd go again.",4
"$100 on dessert!!!!!!!!! I nearly passed out when i saw the bill : / Here's the story: On Saturday nights during the summer months, Navy Pier does a fireworks show at 10pm. So i had the bright idea of watching the fireworks display from a nice view, while sipping on some wine and enjoying some dessert. Well, i looked thru our hotel guide book and found that Everest (located at the top of the Chicago Stock Exchange) was a block away from us and according to some Yelp reviews has 'THE best view in the city'. 'Sweet!' - i thought So we're at the restaurant and i feel COMPLETELY under dressed!!!

"Only place I've ever been to in Chicago for Pizza as I was only there for two days on business and didn't get a chance to try any other places. I thought it was delicious! I even brought two slices back to Philadelphia with me :)",4
"This was my first time in Chicago, so OF COURSE I had to try deep dish. I'd asked a bunch of Chicago-ans about their favorite places to eat earlier and had sparked an INTENSE debate about which pizza place was best, but this place seemed to have the most votes. I actually stumbled here on accident after touring Northwestern Law, but I'm glad I did! It was just me, so I ordered an individual sausage deep dish and added some spinach (about 7 or 8 bucks IIRC). It was INTENSE. Soooo delicious. I am a BIG fan of cheese and I loved that when they served it, it was all still melty and stretchy and stringy, and the spinach and sausage were plentiful enough that I didn't feel cheated. My favorite part, however, was the crust. It wasn't hard or anything--it was delicious, almost sort of flaky, soft ",4
"Loved the food.  The meat ragu was delicious and the pizzas were pretty good as well.  Staff was knowledgable of the food and although it wasnt that busy the place was very warm.",4
"**I'm revising my 5 star review down to 4. The place has seen some employee turnover recently, and my wraps are no longer perfect. I figured once the new guys got the hang of making them, things would be better, but that's not really the case. Too bad.** This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Wraps and sandwiches are adorned generously with meats, cheeses, lettuce, and other condiments. My favorite wraps are the Fresno (asparagus and turkey) and Rosie's sloppy veggie wrap (black beans and pico de gallo). Wraps always come with a good portion of tortilla chips with salsa and guacamole. I only wish they would hand out larger portions of both - I tend to use up all the salsa and guac before I'm done with my chips. For sandwiches, the Brighton (turkey, cranberry sauce) and the Laguna (tuna) a",5

"Ok so I ended up here with a YouSwoop.  I always would walk by the ENO on Michigan Ave so when the deal came, I was in....however, I didnt know it was for the Fairmont.  Anyway, we went on a Sunday night.  I totally felt like a tourist in my city :) Eno is literally in the lobby of the hotel....I wasnt a fan, however it was a nice little set up, especially if you are visiting from out of town. The wine list was definitely complete.  I liked the variety of flights.  The best part of the night was when the sommelier started opening up bottles for us to try!  The staff was totally personable and the price was definitely reasonable for the tourist-y area.  Now, sometimes you had to wait a couple of minutes for your wine fix, but we were in no rush so it didnt bother us. I would go back, despit",4
"I come here nearly every day for a breakfast bagel and cream cheese.  The staff gets easily overwhelmed because the ordering system needs some adjustments, but they work hard and at least twice a week I leave a $1 tip. However, I find the $4 minimum totally annoying.  While apparently such minimums are (as of recent legislation) no longer illegal, I think they are a bad policy when you have a daily customer who pays cash day after day.  Only twice in almost a year of going to Jaffa bagel every weekday morning have I asked to use my debit card for the $2 transaction.  This morning, the reason I only had $1 in my wallet was because I gave Jaffa bagel employees a $1 tip yesterday! The manager readily accommodated my request this time, but the counter employees seemed flustered by my request t",4
"My friend and I ordered a medium special stuffed pizza and that sucker fed us for 2 meals! We got it to go, so we didn't have to deal with the service that people here complained about. However, even though we ordered it to go, we still had to wait 50 minutes for our pizza to be done! Onto the pizza! As a Californian, a real stuffed pizza was a new experience. There's just so much with a thick layer of cheese and a layer of sauce that's just enough and not overpowering. It's a solid pizza.",4
"Before I even get into the food here, let me first say that to the people that are frightened by the line - you should ORDER FIRST then go and pick it up! I never wait in line here for food. I go straight down the steps - pick up my order and go up the back steps where the you can come up to more seating. Anyway, moving on to the food. Most things that I've tried here are absolutely delicious.  Everything is fresh and made to order. I'm stuck on making my own sandwich from the sandwich board. However, The Vail is great and so is the Chicken Caesar Wrap. The salads are huge and great also.   I highly suggest that people try out this place and like I stated before order before you get there. Their menu is online for printing and it'll make your experience much better! Enjoy!",4

Framing: Been here several times, alone and with others. This review is based largely on my dinner alone this week, but incorporates thoughts from other visits as well. Dined 3/12/09 - bill was $47 with wine, soup and entree. Food: Great food. I had a soup that was FANTASTIC. It was the special soup, with mussels and shrimp in a spciy tomato based white wine sauce. AWESOME!!! For dinner, I had a repeat favorite, the wide noodle pasta with wil boar. Again, very good, albeit I continued to think it was not the most healthy item on the menu. Wine selection is also good, but not great. My chianti was",4
"I like the food at Eleven City and don't mind paying a little extra, I don't think I've been able to finish a meal yet, because of the huge portions. I loved the Reuben and the french toast is probably the best I've had that wasn't made by my Dad as a kid. As far as the spotty service goes, of the three times I've been there so far, the service was pretty bad 2 out of 3 times with the most recent being the best service so I don't think it'll keep me from coming back.",4
"It was 5pm and me and my friends wanted breakfast....THANK YOU Eleven City Diner. I got some really good pancakes for about 6 bucks. I also tasted the hash browns which were pretty damn tasty. I would've given this 5 stars except the tip was included for parties of like 5 or something so..be careful if you only have enough for what the menu says. The waitress was pretty nice by the way.

"George's is one best dive bars around. The bartenders are extremely friendly, and if you're by yourself waiting for someone, they're glad to strike up a conversation if they're not busy. The price of drinks is very cheap, and its a very comforting atmosphere. I've never seen the place packed, or anyone having an issue inside. It's truly a diamond in the rough for its location. Although, frequently on weekends there is a famous panhandler that will hangout outside. He's quite a feisty 'little' guy, but if you live in Chicago, you've seen worse. Great place, great drinks, great prices, great fun.",4

My favorite wrap would be the veracruz. I wish they would open one closer to my job. Use to go here all the time for lunch. They do get super packed from noon - 1pm. Best bet is to go early or take a late lunch.",4
"Awesome Pizza. I've been here but my wife hadnt. She fell in love and she isnt a huge pizza fan (I know, but she's beautiful so I put up with it ;-)). The wait was long but nothing out of the oridnary even on a Saturday night withe Air and Water show going on. The pre- ordering that they do while you wait really minimizes the time that you have to wait once you get your table. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. The only negative was the location that they put us. It was too close to the other table and I kept having to move anytime someone got up or when staff cleaned the table. The Pizza was worth the hassle however.",4
"I so wanted to hate this place; don't even ask why because I don't know.  However, it was delicious and fulfilled all of my fantasies of eating a dripping wet...all-natural...burger. I have to admit, for a 'fast-food' joint, it was darn G-O-O-D.  Granted, half way through my burger, I had the special sauce on my suit and an empty bun from where all the meat used to be.  But, I can't complain; it just meant that somehow I was eating so fast that I lost sight of the burger/bun ratio.  The fries were decent, although I do like Patty's fries better.   The food gets 5 stars, but the girl at the counter was rude to me even though I was the only one in line and she took forever to even acknowledge me(hmmm...) so the one star is dropped for that.",4
"I have been to Exchequer many many times but mostly to drink and never for food. I also never knew how big the place was as I always sat up front near the bar. So when I went out for pizza with a friend there I was very surprised. The weird thing was they sat us toward the side back room where nobody was seating at. We thought we were being singled out for being weird or something. Actually it was nice to sit away from other annoying patrons and was even easier to enjoy the food and company. We ordered a cheese only pan pizza and I had an Oberon and she had a Diet Coke and Rum. When the pizza did come I have to say it was really fantastic. The cheese was so good and the sauce was not overwhelming unlike some other pan pizza places were the sauce is just ridiculous. We ate and hung out for ",4
"I thought the first time I ate here I was going to go home and die because honestly? The decor reminded me of this place in Brooklyn that gave me food poisoning. Thankfully I am still alive.

"Just ordered lunch for a big office meeting today and got a variety of wraps, salad and a small desert tray for 30+ people.  Needless to say, everyone LOVED the wraps and were going crazy over the guacamole.  Personally, I had a wrap that was filled with yummy taboulis goodness (don't even see that one on the menu, but it was amazing!), lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, turkey and large creamy slices of avocado. Although I was't thrilled with my experience in ordering the lunch through the catering staff over the phone, the delicious food that arrived in large portions made up for it. I will definitely order from them again!",4

"Today at work I am chained to my desk.  No bathroom breaks, no afternoon jaunts, nothing.  It is awful.  When it came time to order lunch, I called Goodwin's - a place in the loop I know will deliver to me, 'the prisoner.'  I almost burst into tears when the lady told me there was a 'minimum order' for lunch deliveries.  I told her I didn't care when it came, but I couldn't possible eat 20 dollars worth of food.  No one else is here to go in on the order. If the phone rings and I don't answer it, it's my head.  She put me on hold.  When she came back, we had a 'sister, I hear you' moment and she said she would tack my delivery on the end of the delivery man's schedule.  SO AWESOME OF HER.

The fact that the sports tins are $3 more is pretty ridiculous.  Otherwise, it would be 5 stars easy!",4

"So it was really cold on this April afternoon, whilst I meander the city in search of a pair of appropriate brown shoes.  My companion, a Wicker Park yuppie recommended we partake in seafood....I on the other hand had another idea. So what is Chicago Style Pizza?  Simply put its trying to get enough cheese into a single pizza to give yourself a coronary.  Its not your traditional pizza, because your cheese and toppings are mixed together, and you have your tomato sauce on top. You can Wikipedia the rest. Giordanos is something of mythic Chicago lore, this is where you can supposedly get some of the best Chicago Stuffed Pizza.

"I'm not much of a critic of Chicago deep dish pizza at this point as I've only tried it once in my life and Giordano's had the pleasure of popping my cherry. The wait is LONG but well worth it. You can order drinks and apps at the bar while you're called which is great if you can fit in... The Service is decent. Don't expect the pizza to come out as quick as a brooklyn-style will, but believe me it's well worth it. (see pics) Will definitely return for some more when back in Chi-town!",4
"Visited Chicago for Independence Day weekend. Wanted to try Chicago style pizza. I tried Giordano's since it was very close to my hotel (Hyatt). The wait was.... LONG! 30 min wait to be seated. Once we were seated, the waiter asked if we had 'Pre-ordered', I wasn't aware that this was an option... I asked the hostess 3 times how much longer to be seated and she never mentioned anything about Pre-ordering... I now know better.. After we placed our order it was another 50 mins before the pizza made it to the table... Im deducting a star for the incredibly long wait. Now for the good, the pizza was AWESOME, FABULOUS, DELISH!!

Round 1- History: Per Giordano's own menu, the place first opened its doors in February 1974 by two brothers from the 'old country' who tried to recreate Mamma's recipe (aw, shucks).  Contrast this with Gino's tale (as noted on their lovely paper placemats) of two taxi-driving paisanos and their bud who got bored and opened the doors of their first pizzeria in 1966. Dilemma: old word ",4

The sauce is perfect (YES IT IS ON TOP IF THE CHEESE), the cheese gooey, and the double crust is heaven. Perfectly spiced.One slice fills me up of pepperoni and cheese. The service is never bad in my experience and I like the atmosphere, very Italian. They have a lunch special too which I always get , you get a salad or soup, your own indvidual stuffed pizza, and a can of pop for like $7 bucks. The sandwiches and appetizers are also delicious, my mom always gets the chicken.  But....get the pizza you won't be sorry trust me!! Greasey flat New York Pizza does not come close...AT ALL!",5

And, I have to say that I actually liked this place better than Pizzeria Uno and Gino's East.  And their crust.... oh emm gee!

Nonetheless, the food at Eleven City is unbelievable.  I got the Sam Levy Chicken sandwich. It was spicy, like I like everything, juicy and I had a lot of fun dipping it in ketchup.

My family and i came here on a trip to visit my son, who had just graduated boot camp.  There was a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon around 3ish or so, we were told we could wait or pre-order our pizza so it would be ready shortly after we were seated.  Best advice we were given that day! We were seated and our pizza arrived within 10-15 minutes.  One slice of this pizza is all you need and i love my pizza (new york style preferred) but this was amazing! I was so full and happy we ended up taking the left overs back to the hotel for a midnight snack!  Street parking may be tough, you can always park at the sears tower parking lot and pay the parking fee, it is so worth it!",5

Anyway, with a pizzeria being a stone throws distant from home I decided to begin my Chicago experience with Giordano's! I ordered for a special deep dish with add on of Canadian bacon. It takes about 30mins for the pizza to be made so one can wait either at the attached bar or as I did, watched the pizza makers do their thing! It can be quite entertaining to watch them make those pizzas so gracefully! I was pleasantly surprised to find how huge the pizza actually is. Little did I imagine before ordering, that gobbling the pizza by myself was a joke! The portions are very generous and since they don't sell by the slice; you will have to buy a full pizza. The",5

The concierge recommended emerald loop and even though we were slightly turned away from the fact that it was an Irish pub, we decided to give it a try and were impressed. The chicken and arugula salad was fantastic with it's raspberry dressing and the shepards pie was good, not as tasty as I like and had to add more salt and pepper. The rest of the menu looked great though, there was something for everyone. Overall I would definately go there again. We were able to enjoy people watching in a busy part of town with scrumptious food.",4

It was made to order with just the right amount of shredded cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. There was a lot of tuna, which is great because now I have lunch for tomorrow. I was also given a generous side of tortilla chips and salsa AND guacamole. Most places charge you for such a thing. My lunch tab was only $6.90- pretty low for Chicago. MMM MMM delish. I will be back.",5
"What a great, new, awesome place to eat lunch in the Loop!  My co-workers and I had lunch there today, and it was my first time, but their third time.  They talked about Jason's Deli so highly that I had to try it out, and I'm really not into eating out at lunch when I live right across the street where I can make my own lunch, change into my pjs and lounge for 45 minutes before going to work.  It takes a special place to deter me from going home for lunch. I had The Great Rueben, and wow, it's an accurate title.  The corned beef was perfect, the sauer kraut was German goodness reincarnate, and the size made the price worth it.  I paid $11.38 for the reuben sandwich, chips, a long slice of pickle and a fountain drink plus soft serve ice cream.  The fountain drinks are $1.99 and all you can",5
"I feel that not enough food service people get recognition when they do a fantastic job, and often only hear from customers who have had a bad experience (though this location seems to be doing just fine in the praise department).   I just wanted to say that whomever the lady at the register was at about noon today is fantastic.  Cheerful, helpful, the whole shebang.   Every visit to this location has been positive.  Keep being awesome!",5
"After a long day at the beach, or shopping on Michgan Ave I love to stop in here for grub. The deep dish is simply amazing. However, I do warn you there is ALWAYS a wait (usually 30-45 min). The servers are nice and do their best to bring you fast service but you really can't blame them if they're a little slow considering it's right off of Michigan Ave and one of the busiest Giordano's restaurants. My friends and I usually pass the time with a few drinks and good conversations...by the time your pizza arrives you'll have barely noticed what time it is.",5
"By far one of the best pizza's in town!!  Seriously, this place is a hidden treasure.  The location seems a bit seedy late night, but Exchequer's is always packed with lots of people. From the appetizers to the specialty drinks and all of the pizza in between -- this place kicks a**!!",5
"I decided to try this chain during my first visit to Chicago, and their deep stuffed pizza did not disappoint. I was so full from only one slice that my family and I (3 of us in total) had to take the rest of the individual pizza (said to serve 1-2 people) to go. The service is friendly, but once the restaurant gets busy (by 1pm, the whole place was PACKED for lunch), the service is slow and frustrating. I don't blame the waitresses since they have to manage 10 tables at once, but with such a successful chain, you'd think the managers would hire some more help to please their numerous customers.",5
"Yum!!! Service was great for a saturday night and st patrick's day. Pizza was awesome...even with the 45 minute wait it was a great experience. I have had other pizza in chicago but giordanos goes to the top of my list.",5
"right when I walked in, i knew I liked this place.  it's warm and inviting.  dimly lit, exposed brick walls.  the building use to be a speak easy and has a ton of character. the service was amazing.  our waiter greeted us promptly and took our drink order and asked if we had any food restrictions/allergies.  we don't -but I thought it was really nice that he asked! the food was AMAZING.   highly reccomended!",5
"My favorite lunch spot in the loop.  Everything I've had has been fresh and delicious, and they are very good about modifications to the standard fare (as one who loathes sour cream, this is key).  The food is varied - sandwiches, wraps, salads, etc - so there is something for everyone.   I lean towards the wraps, which come with chips, salsa, and guac.  Personally, the salsa is a little spicy, but they always let me swap it for a guac instead.",5
"I eat here AT LEAST once a week during the work week.  They have a really simple menu - beef, chicken, turkey, or portabello burger.  Grilled chicken with grilled onions is excellent.  The fries are stellar.  Definitely worth checking out if in the area.",4
"Five stars for being edible and open in this district for dinner.",5
"They should have called this place Giordan-wow's. It made me wanna shut my mouth and slap my grandma.",5
"I've been in here a couple times...First off they have a Good Selection of beers, and I'm not talking about bud, bud light miller or any other swill. They have GOOD beers ie: Guinness,Harp, Fullers, Smithwicks ect...  The Atmosphere is nice it really does resemble an old English pub. The food however is better than most English pubs or at least the ones I've been too.  They have a lot of traditional English fair such as Bangers and Mash, Shepard's pie, bread pudding (which is absolutely amazing!!!!) and also burgers and chicken fingers (beer battered) All in all, a great little Pub.....Bang On!",5
"Last year when I went to Chicago for the first time, I came home and almost died... because my boyfriend almost killed me for NOT eating any pizza and in addition, not bringing HIM any pizza. Whoopsie. So not wanting to repeat the same mistake, I made damn sure to order a pizza from Giordano's the night before departure so I could take it home. I called Giordano's on Rush because it was the closest one to my hotel. At 10:30pm, their oven was broken! oh Shit! I'm about to be in trouble, I thought to myself. So I called the next closest location which happened to be this one and they told me to call the one on Rush. I told them their oven was broken and therefore they agreed to drive me my pizza. When he arrived with my hot pepperoni pie, I was soooooo excited! Although I'd already had dinne",5
"Man, this place knows how to rock the deep dish pizza.  I discovered some reviews on yelp, and since then it's been in the lunch rotation.  It takes a while to make-and count on it taking the full 45 minutes-but they remind you about this when you order, and you can always call them ahead of time so your pizza will be ready when you arrive.  I'd never ventured further than their pizza until our office had one of our retirement parties there.  Oh man.  For a little over twenty bucks we had pop, beer, and wine for drinks.  Our package included ceasar salad, chicken, beef kabob, potatoes, and on and on.  So tasty.  What really impressed me was they kept refilling everything, even when it seemed like everyone was winding down.  Oh, and when we were done, they brought out a bunch of to go boxes",5
"I love Gioco!  My husband and I have been going for a long time and every time we have enjoyed the food and service. The wine selection is plentiful. The muscles are really tasty and the gnocchi is good also. I can't wait to go back!! Me",5
"This is a top-of-the line dining establishment.  The restaurant is located high up in an office tower and has wonderful views of the City.  The food is fabulous and the wine list is overwhelming.  It's all great.  Pricing adds up to a bill that is likely larger than the annual budget of a small country.  Service is impeccable.",5
"I came here for a bachelorette party. They were playing Two Door Cinema Club, Passion Pit and Band of Horses : ) mmmmmm. Thank you. Also the food was good and the service was too. The atmosphere was typical pub except cleaner which was nice. The prices were decent for the loop. They have a shotski : ) Pub in the loop? Yes. Go here.",5
"Surrounded by chain restaurants, this place holds its own, despite no longer being able to make sandwiches (wraps-only these days).  If you're looking for a sandwich, however (the California Club is delicious), just hop over to the outpost across the street on the first floor of the Smurfit Stone building.",5
"A very good French style restaurant.  The view of the city is nice, especially on a clear day.  Although, I still feel that the John Hancock has the best view.  Food is delicious.  It's a set course meal.  You can choose from either 3 course, 4 course, or tasting menu.  It started out at $89 for the 3 course meal, and I can't seem to remember the prices for the rest.  There were 4 of us holding an early birthday celebration for my sister, and we had the following: Starters: - Roasted Maine Lobster in Alsace Gewurztraminer Butter and Ginger - Casco Bay Sea Scallops, Alsace Cabbage Salad, Caraway Seed and Melfor -  Vintage Carnaroli Risotto, Wild Forest Mushrooms Entrees: - Classic Baked Filet of Sea Bass Backaoffa Alsace Style - Magret of Mulard Duck, Wild Pine Honey, Marinated Turnips à la",5
"A Korean fast food restaurant in the Loop!  Located on the 2nd floor of the Lake/Clark St food court. Authentic Korean food owned and operated by Koreans.  I had the BeeBimBop and it was delicious.  Vegetables were varied. The hot sauce was on side so u can control the spiciness.  Highly recommend checking out.  They didn't have a carry out menu for the Korean food, just the Vietnamese Big Pho side.",5
"Two blocks from my office. Had my sammich in about 60 seconds.   Everything is fresh and crisp. If I had to literally live on bread alone for the rest of my life, it would have to be Jimmy John's fesh bread. 'Nough said.",5

"At first, the name 'stuffed crust' really through me off as I am an out of towner. So we came to Girdano's after trying Gino's previously because I didn't want to truy 'stuffed crust', I wanted deep dish. Well their stuffed crust IS their deep dish- which you can get plain. I enjoyed Giordano's crust much better - very doughy and cooked perfectly with a soft inside and crispy outside.. Delious plain pizza - we didn't get anything stuffed inside. But the crust made the pizza and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs as we had to take some home!",4
"My hubby and I were treated to dinner by some friends at Everest and all four of us said this was possibly the best dinner we have had. We did the tasting menu with wine pairing and the whole experience was just incredible. The whole thing was, of course, very expensive, but since we weren't paying for it, we were able to just enjoy it and not worry about the cost! I loved that we were able to enjoy the whole meal and not rush....we looked down and we had already been there for 4 hours without even realizing it! Again, we loved Everest and would recommend it to anyone who was looking for a 5 star night out!",4
"I loveee Giordano's deep dish & to all my fellow Chicagoians i know, i know it's very anti-Chicago to eat at chain restaurants but before you curse me and make me move to the suburbs i've tired every pizza place in my neighborhood & for deep dishes they make it best perfect dough and they put the toppings under the cheese like a true deep dish.  They are a little pricey for pizza but you gotta pay sometimes for quality.  If you come to visit check it out",5
"This was the first thing that I got at Chicago after landing here. My first flight was cancelled and I was famished. I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but my friend knew this place, though it be a slight food chain feel, was something special in Chicago (and apparently Florida). We got the pizza that could be shared 3-4 people, but obviously my friend and I finished the thing. We ordered the stuffed pizza with sausage and mushrooms. When this thing came out (about a 30-40 minute wait) I was amazed at the height of this thing. I had my first bite and I was in LOVE. ABSOLUTE LOVE with this dinner. It's just amazing and I realized why it takes soo long to make. 20 Minutes for the first layer of pizza and your picked toppings, and 20 minutes for the second layer (tomato sauce and c",5
"This was the only Chicago Deep Dish I've ever had.... and it was delicious.",5
"Jamba Juice is as good as it gets. For a nice healthy boost, while you are on the go, Jamba Juice will always hit the spot. They have a variety of different flavors and shakes. They also have oatmeal and other items such as protein bars, granola, muffins etc.... This particular location is right on Michigan Avenue across from Millenium Park. I was running errands and happened to stop by for a quick fix. The staff was very helpful and very friendly. Plus, they were busy and I still got my shake in about 4 or 5 minutes. They even signed me up for their rewards program and gave me free stamps for future shakes. It was pretty awesome to say the least.",5
"The Chicago Mix is heaven... I didn't know what the big deal was w. the popcorn place until I had it.  It's a big deal. If you're in the Windy City, pass by one of the locations, make the line, & have some Mix! Sooooo good!",5
"So happy we stumbled upon this place. After walking around the Art Institute all morning we found ourselves starved and in the mood for authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. We asked a random guy on the side of the road where the nearest place was, and all he had to say was 'Giordano's.' We arrived around 3pm on a Thursday and got a table right away. Though the service itself was a little slow, we didn't mind as we were eating with an old friend and had much discussion to catch up on anyway. We ordered a large deep dish, stuffed crust 1/2 cheese, 1/2 sausage pizza. Some soda and bread held us over as we waited nearly an hour for our food to arrive, but the relaxed and very visually interesting decor of the restaurant, in addition to it's cleanliness and nice wait staff, made the wait worth it",4
"Giordano's deep dish pizza is better than sex. It sucks living in California because we dont have any deep dish pizza places here. I plan on buying a home soon in Chicago so I can go to portillos, giordanos, and whitesox games.",5
"Wow.  This was really fun. On Rosh Hashana eve, when good Jews like us should be at the Synagogue, we went into the city to visit our daughter and take her out to dinner.  She works up at Water Tower Place and goes to college in the south Loop, so she took the El down to meet us, and we walked over to Eleven City Diner. The diner has been there about four years, although I have to admit I'd not heard of it before.  They set it up to look like a New York Deli, sort of like the Carnegie Deli, although it is much more spacious.  In fact, they compare themselves to the Carnegie. When we arrived, my wife mentioned we were there to celebrate Rosh Hashana.  The waiter immediately took us to a reserved table with white linens on it.   They had several of these set up around the place just for that",5
"My first trip to Chicago. I was in town for less than 24 hours in February, and was staying with a friend's sister. The plane touched down pretty late in the afternoon, so we only had time for one meal. 'What do you want to eat?' she asks when she picks me up at the airport. 'PIZZA.' Everyone knows about Chicago's deep dish pizza. How could I leave the city without trying it? Coming from LA, Chicago is freaking FREEZING. The block and a half we walked from our parking space to the restaurant was like torture. So the blast of warm air and delicious pizza smells right as I walked through the door immediately made this place great. It was pretty packed, but the wait was still only about 20 minutes. We ordered our veggie pizza before we were seated to make the wait a little shorter. Service wa",5
"I think I can safely say this is the best Pizza I have ever had in my life!  I have had other pizza in Chicago before, had really good pizza slices in NYC, had amazing pizza in California (yes I said it, California actually does have some very good pizza in certain areas) and plenty of pizzas all over the country.  Pizza is always something I love getting everywhere I go because the pizza flavor, style and consistency differs so much from place to place.  Giordano's really impressed me.  This pizza is definitely living up to the stuffed pizza label, it filled me up on 3 slices....can I call them slice? It filled me up on 3 slabs!!!  We had plenty to take back on the train with us, and I think it was almost as good heated up the next day as it was when we had it, thought not quite as good. ",5

"It's expensive and horrible for you, sort of like heroin.  And once you've had it, it's hard not to go back.  Like heroin.  Echoing the words of Becca B., the cheese/caramel mix will change the way you look at popcorn.  It certainly makes the sad drive back to Ohio a little happier though. If you don't like it *twitch*, more for me *twitch*.",5
"Bag of mixed. It's a Chicago staple for a reason. It's cheesy, it's sweet, it's Chicago in a bag. Awesome to grab a bag and go hit the town. Just bring napkins! - Eat on!",5
"I asked my best friend for some real Chicago style pizza and she took me here.  This was some of the best pizza I have ever eaten!  I can't wait to go back in June.  The Cheese and how deep the pizza was...wow.  I'm not a fan of red sauce (yes even on my pizza), so I was able to just scrape it off..and it worked well with it on top! Its a DO, for anyone in Chicago!  You will wait a little while so hopefully the person you are eating with is entertaining.",5
"Still the best darn pizza in Chicago. I visit every time I am in town. The deep dish is the way to go and make sure you pre-order by phone it will save you a 40 minute wait. Giordano's has done an excellent job of keeping the taste, service and quality as they have grown I first visited in the 80's and did the Rush street location almost weekly in college. They still have the goods!!!",5
"It's Garrett's.  I don't even like popcorn, but I love this stuff.",5
"Can I say, AMAZING!!! I love this place.  I had a turkey burger and my husband had a beef burger. The ingredients are all organic and you can taste it. They're just so simple. Meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions on a fresh baked bun. The bun its self is so yummy. Anyway, don't like writing long reviews so I'll just say this.........TRY IT OUT FOR YOURSELF!!!!!",5
"Soooo addictive, the Chicago Mix will have you inhaling hot, crunchy sweet and salty popcorn like your life depended on it. The mix of cheddary cheesy and caramel popcorn seems weird, IS weird, but tastes absolutely fanfuckingtastic. Seriously, it seems like the bag is practically gone in mere minutes. Because it is.",5
"AMAZING!  Best Pizza and a nice place to eat.",5
"Free-range beef burger.  Doesn't get any better than this.  Old school buttery bun and caramelized onions to order.  Fries are fresh cut and delicious.  As others have mentioned, this is no 'low fat' burger.  It can be greasy, no lie.  (However, the dessert brownies that are tempting you on the counter aren't that good, run down to nearby Panera for a tasty pastry). Some have complained about the lack of menu options.  Personally, I like that they stick to what they know and don't put a ton of salads in the fridge case or try to sell things they are not good at.  Simply menu is the way to go. A little on the pricey side for lunch, but definitely worth it if you enjoy a good burger that was grass fed and treated humanely.  Some have mentioned that they should be paying less because it is a ",5

"Great little grease factory in the south loop, just  a block and half away from the Harold Washington branch of the Chicago Public Library. Actually a decent value, I've paid more for a burger and fries in the suburbs. Fantastic mozzarella sticks too. The inside is small, maybe 9-10 tables and a 3-4 person bar. In the summer they set up a few outdoor tables. If you come during normal lunch times be prepared to get creative in your eating location.",5
"Do yourself a favor. Do the supper veggie. The little broccoli is so cute!",5
"Until a few days ago, I had never been inside Garrett's.  It was one of those treats that I loved but always ate when someone brought it to work or a party.  However, I wanted to bring something to Thanksgiving and there wasn't a pie shop in site. When I went in to order, I knew that it would expensive but I had no idea of the price. I ordered a 2 gallon tin and realized that it was $55.  Wowser. After paying, I realized that I could get 2 gallons in bags for $26.  Since my family could care less about the tins, I was hoping that they would let me change my order.  Since there was hardly anyone in line, they did.  Thank you!",5
"I ordered a deep dish pepperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza and although it took an hour for it to be delivered, it was well worth the wait.  The pizza was filled with cheese and yummy goodness and the crust is so addicting - it is buttery and light and just the perfect combo for a carb lover.  I could only eat 2 pieces before passing out but so good - a must try!  I also heard that the spinach stuffed pizza was good too - try this place!",5
"Utter deliciousness in the form of a burger.  I got an egg in mine and it was the most brilliant thing ever.  I don't care that it is organic, but that's nice too.  I just care that it tasted like heaven.",5
"Give me some good FF's with too much ketchup and I'm happy. Mix that in with a turkey burger and a cute dude who keeps asking me how I'm doing...I'll never want to leave. I almost requested hitting this place up for dinner when I was there for lunch on the same day. ALMOST. But I did pull a 'Hook' and imagine my dinner salad was my turkey burger/ff lunch. RUFIO",4
"I've been to many locations and they all taste the same. So I picked this location to review because it was first on the list! :) I'm popping cheddar and caramel crisp popcorn in my mouth as I type. Jealous? Heehee. I love Garrett Popcorn! Anyone visiting Chicago MUST try Garrett Popcorn! If you live in Chicago and have not tried it, shame on you!",5
"Giordano's is the best place for Chicago-style pizza, hands down, end of story. Better than Lou Malnatis and much better than the cheese-and-sauce soup in a bland crust they serve at Gino's East. If you have yet to experience the magic of Chicago-style deep dish or have guests from out of town wondering what the fuss is about, go here. Also neat: if you live anywhere in the contiguous US outside of Chicago, Giordano's will ship you a half-baked pizza on dry ice for you to finish baking yourself. It's not quite as good as eating it fresh from the restaurant but it got my family by when were living in Pennsylvania!",5
"Fantastic pie!  It was very busy, but we got seated about 30 minutes after we walked-in on a Friday night.  A deep dish pie takes about 40 minutes to cook.  The staff didn't rush us; in fact they were very attentive.  The food was well worth the wait.",5
"This place has some of the best fries I have ever tasted and I like the staff.  If I'm on Wabash, I cannot resist stopping in even if I'm not hungry.   Fries are fat and crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  My usual order is Italian beef combo, but I will eat the fries there and save the whopper of a sandwich for later.  It's awesome and they are not chintzy with the peppers like Portillo's is. That said, GCD does not have the ambience of Portillo's on Ontario, but I go for the food.  To me,  GCD beef and fries are WAY superior. I don't eat hot dogs, so I can't comment on those.  But the combo menu is the way to go.     Nice, fast, friendly staff.   Same guy has been serving me there for years.",5
"The cheese deep-dish was the best slice of pizza I've had in probably a year. The service was absolutely perfect.",5
"Five stars for just what I needed...pho on a shopping trip!  It was a depressing food court, as Jessie F. says, but worth the trip inside.  Seems to get a lot of neighborhood people, though, which speaks highly of its food.  The service was wonderful.  The proprietor even brought me a 'real' bowl when he found I was going to eat at the little table on the mall side, instead of carry out.",5
